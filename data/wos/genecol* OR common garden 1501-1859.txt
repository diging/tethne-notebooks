AB Evaporative water loss in Anolis cristatellus from the British Virgin Islands was negatively correlated with the aridity of their habitats. Phenotypic plasticity and/or differential mortality of less well-adapted individuals allowed rapid changes within populations. Here we report the results of two studies intended to differentiate between the two processes. We rook advantage of the end of a major drought to study the rapidity with which populations recovered from unusually dry conditions. Population values changed rapidly from those measured in the past. There was no correlation between long-term habitat aridity and measured water-loss rate, bur the multiyear correlation between aridity and skin resistance to water loss persisted. We also conducted a common garden experiment in which animals from the wettest and driest habitats were housed under intermediate conditions for one month. We detected no change in skin resistance to water loss in any of the three populations we studied; however, the mass of lizards from Sage Mountain increased significantly during the experiment, and their water loss per unit mass decreased significantly. These results support the existence of both phenotypic plasticity and genetic differences resulting from rapid selection within populations. The magnitude and relative importance of the two, however, remain to be determined.

AB The biology and host range of the two root-mining weevils Diplapion confluens Kirby and Coryssomerus capucinus (Beck), two potential agents for the biological control of scentless chamomile Tripleurospermum perforatum (Merat) Lainz, were studied in the field in southern Germany and eastern Austria, and in a common garden and under laboratory conditions in Delemont, Switzerland from 1993 to 1999. Both weevils were univoltine, and females started to lay eggs in early spring. Diplapion confluens had three and C. capucinus five instars. Larvae of both species were found in the field from mid-April until the end of July; later instars preferentially fed in the vascular cylinder of the shoot base, root crown or root. Although larvae of both species occupy the same temporal and spatial niche within their host plants, they occurred at all investigated field sites together, and showed a similar distribution within sites. No negative or positive interspecific association was detected. Host-specificity tests including no-choice, single-choice, and multiple-choice tests under confined conditions, as well as tests under field conditions with natural and augmented insect densities revealed that both herbivores were specific to plant species in the tribe Anthemideae. However, their development to mature larva or adult on several cultivated plants, as well as on one plant species native to North America, rendered them unsuitable for field release in North America. It was concluded that to investigate non-target effects reliably, host-specificity tests with biological control agents should be carried out under a variety of conditions, particularly with augmented insect densities, as are expected to occur naturally after release.

AB In plants, the ratio of red to far-red wavelengths (R:FR) reliably indicates neighbor proximity and influences stem elongation. Enhanced elongation increases light interception and fitness under crowded conditions. However. many environmental factors vary simultaneously such that responses to R:FR may be affected by abiotic conditions or maternal environmental conditions. This study examines the effects of temperature, photoperiod, and maternal environment on stem-elongation responses to R:FR. Four populations of Abutilon theophrasti (two from disturbed, weedy areas and two from cornfields) were used in factorial common-garden experiments of temperature X R:FR X population and photoperiod X R:FR X population. Seedling growth of greenhouse- and field-derived seed was compared to evaluate maternal effects. Maternal environment did not alter seedling elongation. Higher temperatures resulted in both a twofold increase in average elongation and increased responsiveness to R:FR. Significant three-way interactions in both experiments demonstrate that population responses to R:FR differ depending on temperature and photoperiod conditions. These results indicate that elongation responses to R:FR are more variable than previously realized. The observed variability in elongation also suggests that the outcome of competitive interactions in the natural environment will depend on ambient temperature, photoperiod length, and population origin.

AB This study investigated the use of lysosomal responses of hemocytes of the common garden snail, Helix aspersa, as biomarker of stress due to exposure to the fungicide copper oxychloride. The neutral red retention (NRR) time assay was employed for this purpose. Two groups of snails were exposed to 80 mug g(-1) and 240 mug g(-1) copper oxychloride in their food, respectively, for a period of 6 weeks. They were compared with a control group to which no copper oxychloride was added. The two groups exposed to the fungicide exhibited significantly higher (p < 0.001) whole body copper concentrations (200.85 +/- 53.5 and 272.24 +/- 67.15 IJ <mu>g g-(1) dry mass, respectively), and significantly shorter (p < 0.001) NRR times (10.22 +/- 3.53 and 2.67 +/- 2.83 min, respectively), after 6 weeks, compared to the control group (67.85 +/- 31.08 <mu>g g(-1) dry mass and 24.44 +/- 8.35 min). In both exposure groups NRR times became progressively shorter as body copper concentrations increased over time. Thus, both exposure concentration and exposure time of copper oxychloride were shown to be important factors influencing lysosomal responses (and therefore NRR times) of H. aspersa hemocytes. It was concluded that these responses in this species, as measured by the NRR time assay, could be considered a useful cellular biomarker of stress resulting from exposure to copper oxychloride.

AB It is often assumed that ecological interactions happen at rapid rates relative to evolutionary change. In this study we examined the development and physiology of an amphibian (Rand sylvatica) from populations found in forested wetlands, and from wetlands that had been cleared by reinvading beaver (Castor canadensis). Embryos from beaver wetlands hatched at lower rates when raised in a shaded, common garden setting compared with embryos from forested wetlands. Larvae from beaver wetlands had higher critical thermal maxima compared with conspecifics from forested wetlands. These patterns suggest that R. sylvatica populations may have diverged rapidly (in less than 36 years) in response to changes in their environment induced by another species. Other agents of thermal change, such as anthropogenic landscape conversion or alteration of global climate, could have analogous impacts on wetland dependent species such as amphibians.

AB In this paper we test population differences in early life-history traits in three grayling Thymallus thymallus populations. The grayling shared ancestors some 80-90 years ago. We performed common-garden experiments at three temperatures (mimicking population-specific summer temperatures), and measured survival and growth rates during early development. We found significant additive genetic variance in size (length and yolk-sac volume) measured at hatching, swim-up and termination of the experiment, and significantly different reaction norms for growth rate and survival during the period of first feeding. In general, each population did best at the temperature experienced in nature. These differences in early life-history traits suggest that natural selection has resulted in local adaptation in a time period of 13-18 generations.

TI Garden sharing and garden stealing in fungus-growing ants
SO NATURWISSENSCHAFTEN
LA English
DT Article
ID EVOLUTION
AB Fungi cultivated by fungus-growing ants (Attini: Formicidae) are passed on between generations by transfer from maternal to offspring nest (vertical transmission within ant species). However, recent phylogenetic analyses revealed that cultivars are occasionally also transferred between attine species. The reasons for such lateral cultivar transfers are unknown. To investigate whether garden loss may induce ants to obtain a replacement cultivar from a neighboring colony (lateral cultivar transfer), pairs of queenright colonies of two Cyphomyrmex species were set up in two conjoined chambers; the garden of one colony was then removed to simulate the total crop loss that occurs naturally when pathogens devastate gardens. Garden-deprived colonies regained cultivars through one of three mechanisms: joining of a neighboring colony and cooperation in a common garden; stealing of a neighbor's garden; or aggressive usurpation of a neighbor's garden. Because pathogens frequently devastate attine gardens under natural conditions, garden joining, stealing and usurpation emerge as critical behavioral adaptations to survive garden catastrophes.

AB Data from a short-term provenance trial of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) were used to illustrate a methodology to help locate breeding zone boundaries using adaptive variation models. Four height growth and survival variables were summarized by principal components analysis (PCA), and the first three axis scores were regressed against climate data determined from a recently developed Ontario Climate Model. The regression equations were used to model the PCA axes, and these models were interpreted as the three main components of adaptive variation in the data. These models were converted to geographic grids using GIS software. In a manner similar to that proposed for differential systematics applications, the Differential Systematic Coefficient (DSC) was adapted to be an indicator of the weighted average rate of change of clinally expressed adaptive variation over distance. An output grid was determined based on the DSC values, such that grid cells with higher coefficient values were made to appear darker on the resultant map; thus, the shaded areas corresponded to steeper portions of the clines of adaptive variation and serve as desirable indicators of the best locations for breeding zone boundaries.

AB Seed weight, seed germination, seedling survival, and juvenile/adult fitness in chasmogamously (CH) and cleistogamously (CL) derived offspring of Oxalis acetosella were compared during three growing seasons, to test hypotheses of fitness differences between the offspring types accounting for the maintenance of cleistogamy. In plots at three field sites, CH and CL seeds originating from all sites were sown to compare the performance of offspring growing in their habitat of origin and offspring growing in new habitats. Seeds were also sown in pots in a common garden, to test for effects of sibling competition. Ct seeds had significantly lower germination than CH seeds in the field, possibly because of lower mean seed weight due to later flowering. Since the outcrossing rate in the CH flowers of O. acetosella is not known, it is uncertain whether the lower CL germination is a consequence of inbreeding depression. CH seeds had higher germination if sown at their home sites than at new sites, white for CL seeds this made no difference; this contradicts the local adaptation hypothesis for cleistogamy. No other fitness differences were found between the offspring types, and the findings did not support the sibling competition or local adaptation hypotheses. We suggest that the maintenance of the dimorphic reproductive system in O. acetosella is not explained by offspring characteristics, but rather by the two flowering phases complementing each other in maximizing annual seed production in the face of environmental variability. It is, therefore, important to include temporal and spatial variation in studies of reproductive strategies.

AB The western terrestrial garter snake (Thamnophis elegans) varies significantly in individual growth rates and life-history traits (maturation, reproduction, and survival) among adjacent populations in nature. This study focuses on assessing the genetic and environmental components of the substantial among-population variation in growth rates. Litters of neonates from nine populations inhabiting either mountain meadow or lakeshore habitat were reared for one year in a common-garden experiment with two temperature treatments. Diet, frequency of feeding, light exposure, and daytime temperatures were identical for all individuals. The two different nighttime temperatures (20 degreesC and 25 degreesC) were chosen to mirror field differences in nighttime thermoregulatory constraints for mountain-meadow and lakeshore snakes, respectively. Temperature and source habitat interacted to affect first-year growth rate. Neonates from meadow dams grew fastest in the cooler treatment, whereas those from lakeshore dams grew fastest in the warmer treatment. The observation that naive neonates, which were gestated and raised under identical conditions, grew fastest in environments characteristic of their natal population is evidence both that there are genetic differences among populations for growth and that these differences reflect adaptation to local habitats at a very small geographic scale. In addition, significant directional selection for large birthweight was measured for neonates from all populations. These results are considered in the context of population colonization history, migration and selection, and competing models for growth rate variation.

AB Multiple provenance trials of red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) were used to demonstrate how geostatistical methods can be applied to develop better seed-transfer guidelines and seed-procurement zones for forestry. Height and survival of 65 provenances from British Columbia were measured at four test sites. Significant genotype x environment interactions were found at the population and family level. Provenances close to each planting sire showed superior performance in growth and survival, suggesting adaptation of red alder to local environments. The environmental basis of local adaptations was evaluated using redundancy analysis. Geographic and climatic variates accounted for approximately equal amounts of the variation in height growth (21 and 23%, respectively), while geographic variates accounted for 60% Of the variation in climatic variables. Loadings of the redundancy variates suggested that both, gene flow and selection by environmental factors shaped geographic patterns of genetic differentiation in red alder. Performance of seed sources at unknown locations was predicted with ordinary kriging throughout the natural range of red alder in British Columbia. General seed-transfer guidelines were then generated with principal component analysis of predicted reaction norms. We found clinal differentiation of reaction norms along the coast from northwest to southeast. Further, the Georgia depression was identified as an area of genetic differentiation. Based on predicted height and survival at two trials that most realistically represented operational planting sites, we derived simple rules for seed transfer. A transfer of 100 km in either direction along the coast was associated with a decline of 2.5% in survival, and approximate to 5 cm in 2-year height. Finally, we showed how maps of predicted performance and associated variance surfaces can be used to develop seed zones for specific objectives, where seed zones are given as maps of probabilities of a seed source performing above or below a given threshold for any combination of traits.

DT Article
DE Aster tripolium; saltmarsh; genotypic variation; environmental variation
AB Genotypic and environmental variation in Aster tripolium L. was studied in common garden experiments and in transplantation experiments in different saltmarsh sites along the estuarine gradient of the Westerschelde and along the elevation gradient of individual saltmarshes. Analysis of the variation in a number of morphologic characters of the inflorescences indicated that this variation is both environmentally as well as genetically controlled. Morphologic differences between an Aster tripolium population of a brackish marsh and a number of populations of a saline marsh were unchanged whether the plants were growing in their original habitat or in a transplant habitat. The population from the brackish marsh had smaller inflorescences with ray florets and a predominantly biennial life cycle, in contrast with the populations of the saline marsh, which had larger inflorescences usually without or with a few ray florets and showed a tendency to a perennial life cycle. We concluded that the variation between the populations of the saline and the brackish marsh is mainly genetically controlled, while the variation within the saline marsh is mainly environmentally controlled.

AB The long-term success of restored populations may be jeopardized by the collection locality of transplants if they are ill matched to their new environment. The home-site advantage hypothesis predicts that the relative success of introduced populations will decrease as their genetic and environmental distance to the local native population increases. We evaluated this hypothesis for a geographically variable shrub, Lotus scoparius, in southern Californian coastal sage scrub by planting two common-garden experiments with seedlings from 12 source populations. The common-garden sites differed in environment and were each home to different source populations of the two taxonomic varieties, L. s. var. scoparius or L. s. var. brevialatus. We used allozyme data from each source population to calculate genetic distances between populations, and a combination of climatic data and soil traits to calculate environmental distances. At the more mesic, coastal common garden, cumulative fitness of transplants (survival x flower production) was inversely related to genetic distance between source and resident populations. At the more xeric, inland common garden, cumulative fitness (survival x size) decreased significantly with both genetic and environmental distance after one taxonomic variety was excluded from analyses. Geographic distance was only weakly correlated with genetic distance and had little value in predicting cumulative fitness of transplants. Our data support the home-site advantage hypothesis and the idea that mis-matching source populations of these genetically differentiated seed sources may result in lowered success of restored or constructed populations. The genetic and environmental similarities of source populations should be considered when source materials are chosen for transplantation.

AB Effects of different combinations of stressors (viz. temperature, food level) on growth, developmental and survival rates of Rana temporaria tadpoles from two geographically widely (approximate to 1500 km) separated populations were studied in a common garden experiment. In both populations, low temperature and low food level lead to lowered growth rates and delayed metamorphosis, whereas high temperature and high food level had the opposite effect. Tadpoles from north metamorphosed earlier and exhibited higher growth rates than tadpoles from south, suggesting local adaptation to shorter growth period and cooler ambient temperature in north. Size at metamorphosis did not differ between the two populations, but when the differences in metamorphic age were accounted for, then the tadpoles from north were larger than those from south. These results suggest considerable adaptive genetic differentiation in growth rates, size and timing of metamorphosis between northern and southern R. temporaria populations. In both populations, high food levels tended to reduce tadpole survival rates and there was a negative correlation between growth and survival rates across different treatments in both populations. In general, tadpoles from north experienced high mortality rates in high food level - low temperature treatments, whereas southern tadpoles experienced high mortality in high food level-high temperature treatments. This suggest that there may be genetic differences among different populations as how they would be influenced by high nutrient loads, such as brought along for example by fertilization of forest or agricultural soils.

AB The effect of parental growth form on ramets introduced to new sites has broad implications for ecological restoration. We asked whether transplants of Spartina foliosa need to come from tall parents in order to produce tall stands for nesting by the Light-Footed clapper rail, one of southern California's many endangered, salt-marsh-dependent species. Tan and short S. foliosa transplants, collected from local salt marshes, were grown in a common garden and in microcosms, with different results. In the common garden, which had hypersaline soil, offspring of tall versus short clones did not differ, but they did respond to soil variations among blocks. In blocks with less sandy soil, stems were taller and up to 5 times more numerous, and patch sizes were up to 3 times larger After two years in low-salinity microcosms, transplants receiving nitrogen additions produced more stems and over twice the total stem length of controls, regardless of parental height form. A slight parental effect was seen in this benign environment; the maximum height of tall-form transplants was 15 cm taller than that of short-form transplants, but the effect did not persist through year 2. Results indicate that both height forms of S. foliosa grew better (taller and more dense) with less environmental stress (lower salinity, more nutrients). We conclude that environmental differences are more important than parental height form in determining S. foliosa growth. This means that, for restoration purposes, S, foliosa ramets can and should be collected from short clones, rather than from existing, prime nesting habitat.

AB Studies of many plants species have demonstrated adaptive genetic differentiation to local environmental conditions. Typically these studies are conducted to evaluate adaptation to contrasting environments. As a consequence, although local adaptation has been frequently demonstrated, we have little information as to the spatial scale of adaptive evolution. We evaluated adaptive differentiation between populations of the annual legume Chamaecrista fasciculata using a replicated common-garden design. Study sites were established in three field locations that are home to native populations of C. fasciculata. Each location was planted for two years with seed from the population native to the study site (home population) and populations located six distances (0.1-2000 km) from each site (transplanted populations). Seeds were planted into the study sites with minimum disturbance to determine the scale of local adaptation, as measured by a home-site fitness advantage, for five fitness components: germination, survival, vegetative biomass, fruit production, and the number of fruit produced per seed planted (an estimate of cumulative fitness). For all characters there was little evidence for local adaptation, except at the furthest spatial scales. Patterns of adaptive differentiation were fairly consistent in two of the three sites, but varied between years. Little genetic variation was expressed at the third site. These results, combined with previous estimates of limited gene flow, suggest that metapopulation processes and temporal environmental variation act together to reduce local adaptation, except over long distances.

AB Zostera noltii plants from two contrasting habitats (the intertidal Zandkreek in the SW Netherlands and a quiet cove Cala Jonquet on the Mediterranean coast of Catalonia, NE Spain) were grown for 28 weeks in a common garden experiment. In this experiment the plants were exposed to two salinities (15 and 35 parts per thousand S) and two seasonal daylength regimes (one representing 22 degrees Northern Latitude or the southern limit of this species in Mauretania and the other of 55 degrees NL or northern Denmark, close to the northern limit).
   Plants from both populations suffered considerable mortality at the high salinity (25% survival for the Dutch and 60% for the Catalonian population) but survival was good at the low salinity. Dutch plants realised similar shoot production as in the field only in the treatment combination of 15 parts per thousand S-55 degrees NL. Surviving Catalonian shoots produced comparable numbers of shoots as in the field in all four treatments and hence were less sensitive to daylength seasonality.
   Although the differences between populations had decreased during the experiment, observed variation in leaf width and rhizome diameter at the end of the experiment was explained largely by the factor source population (contributed 73 and 83%, respectively, to total variation in a threeway ANOVA comparing effects of source population, daylength regime and salinity). For total biomass produced, shoot length and weight, root length as well as rhizome internode length, the experimental salinities and daylength regimes often also explained comparable proportions of variance.
   It is concluded that: (a) the observed quantitative differences between the two populations of Z. noltii must have a considerable genetic basis, (b) plants from both populations were not well equipped to survive at worldwide average seawater salinity of 35 parts per thousand S, and (c) the Dutch population responded more vigorously to the more pronounced daylength seasonality of northern latitudes, which is coupled to its higher photosynthetic light requirements.

AB On range-wide and regional scales, climate and site factors exert control over tree growth, masking the genetic basis of biomass accumulation and allocation. To determine intrinsic population differences in productivity, aboveground net primary production (ANPP) was measured in 16-year-old Scots pine from 19 geographically distinct populations grown in a common garden experiment in central Poland (52 degrees N). The populations originated from the northern (>55 degrees N), central (54-47 degrees N), and southern (<45 degrees N) European range of Scots pine. We calculated ANPP from aboveground growth components, using diameter-based allometric equations developed for this site. Average foliage, aboveground woody and total ANPP differed significantly among populations and were greater for central European populations than for the southern and northern ones. Stocking and total ANPP per tree were positively correlated to stand aboveground biomass (r(2)greater than or equal to 0.71). The relationship between the latitude of seed origin and ANPP was curvilinear and maximum for populations originating near the planting site (52 degrees N). ANPP declined in populations with increasing longitude eastward from the Atlantic Ocean towards the center of the continent. This study underscores the potentially large genetic control of ANPP and biomass accumulation among diverse Scots pine populations.

AB We explored environmental and genetic factors affecting seasonal dynamics of starch and soluble nonstructural carbohydrates in needle and twig cohorts and roots of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L,.) trees of six populations originating between 49 degrees and 60 degrees N, and grown under common garden conditions in western Poland. Trees of each population were sampled once or twice per month over a 3-year period from age 15 to 17 years.
   Based on similarity in starch concentration patterns in needles, two distinct groups of populations were identified; one comprised northern populations from Sweden and Russia (59-60 degrees N), and another comprised central European populations from Latvia, Poland, Germany and France (49-56 degrees N). Needle starch concentrations of northern populations started to decline in late spring and reached minimum values earlier than those of central populations. For all populations, starch accumulation in spring started when minimum air temperature permanently exceeded 0 degrees C. Starch accumulation peaked before bud break and was highest in 1-year-old needles, averaging 9-13% of dry mass. Soluble carbohydrate concentrations were lowest in spring and summer and highest in autumn and winter. There were no differences among populations in seasonal pattern of soluble carbohydrate concentrations. Averaged across all populations, needle soluble carbohydrate concentrations increased from about 4% of needle dry mass in developing current-year needles, to about 9% in 1- and 2-year-old needles. Root carbohydrate concentration exhibited a bimodal pattern with peaks in spring and autumn. Northern populations had higher concentrations of fine-root starch in spring and autumn than central populations. Late-summer carbohydrate accumulation in roots started only after depletion of starch in needles and woody shoots. We conclude that Scots pine carbohydrate dynamics depend partially on inherited properties that are probably related to phenology of root and shoot growth.

AB Variation in cold-hardiness traits, and their extent of genetic control and interrelationships, were investigated among individuals (clones) within a single large full-sib family of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) from Oregon. Cold injury to needle, stem, and bud tissues was evaluated in fall 1996 and spring 1997 following artificial freeze testing of detached shoots collected from 4-year-old ramets (rooted cuttings). Variation among clones in cold-injury scores was significant (p < 0.01) for all shoot tissues in both fall and spring and averaged about three times the magnitude previously observed among open-pollinated families of this species. Thus, improving cold hardiness by within-family selection appears to hold much promise. Striking similarities in relative magnitudes of heritability estimates and genetic correlations in the full-sib family, compared with breeding populations, support the following hypotheses about the quantitative genetics of cold hardiness in this species: (i) heritability of cold hardiness (both broad-and-narrow-sense) is stronger in the spring than in the fall; (ii) cold hardiness of different shoot tissues in the same season is controlled by many of the same genes; and (iii) genetic control of fall cold hardiness is largely independent of cold hardiness in the spring.

AB Population-specific differences in the freezing resistance of Metrosideros polymorpha leaves were studied along an elevational gradient from sea level to tree line (located at ca. 2500 m above sea level) on the east flank of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii. In addition, we also studied 8-yr-old saplings grown in a common garden from seeds collected from the same held populations. Leaves of low-elevation field plants exhibited damage at -2 degrees C, before the onset of ice formation, which occurred at -5.7 degrees C. Leaves of high-elevation plants exhibited damage at ca. -8.5 degrees C, concurrent with ice formation in the leaf tissue, which is typical of plants that avoid freezing in their natural environment by supercooling. Nuclear magnetic resonance studies revealed that water molecules of both extra- and intracellular leaf water fractions from high-elevation plants had restricted mobility, which is consistent with their low water content and their high levels of osmotically active solutes. Decreased mobility of water molecules may delay ice nucleation and/or ice growth and may therefore enhance the ability of plant tissues to supercool. Leaf traits that correlated with specific differences in supercooling capacity were in part genetically determined and in part environmentally induced. Evidence indicated that lower apoplastic water content and smaller intercellular spaces were associated with the larger supercooling capacity of the plant's foliage at tree line. The irreversible tissue-damage temperature decreased by ca. 7 degrees C from sea level to tree line in leaves of field populations. However, this decrease appears to be only large enough to allow M. polymorpha trees to avoid leaf tissue damage from freezing up to a level of ca. 2500 m elevation, which is also the current tree line location on the east flank of Mauna Loa. The limited freezing resistance of M. polymorpha leaves may be partially responsible for the occurrence of tree line at a relatively low elevation in Hawaii compared with continental tree lines, which can be up to 1500 m higher. If the elevation of tree line is influenced by the inability of M. polymorpha leaves to supercool to lower subzero temperatures, then it will be the first example that freezing damage resulting from limited supercooling capacity can be a factor in tree line formation.

AB Geographic patterns of intraspecific variations in traits related to photosynthesis and biomass were examined in two separate common garden experiments using seed collected from 26 Sitka alder (Alnus sinuata Rydb.) and 18 paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) populations from climatically diverse locations in British Columbia, Canada. Exchange rates of carbon dioxide and water vapour were measured on 2-year-old seedlings to determine the maximum net instantaneous photosynthetic rate, mesophyll conductance, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic water use efficiency. Height, stem diameter, root and shoot dry mass and fall frost hardiness data were also obtained. Mean population maximum photosynthetic rate ranged from 10.35 to 14.57 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in Sitka alder and from 14.76 to 17.55 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in paper birch. Based on canonical correlation analyses, populations from locations with colder winters and shorter (but not necessarily cooler) summers had higher maximum photosynthetic rates implying the existence of an inverse relationship between leaf longevity and photosynthetic capacity. Significant canonical variates based on climatic variables derived for the seed collection sites explained 58% and 41% of variation in the rate of photosynthesis in Sitka alder and paper birch, respectively. Since growing season length is reflected in date of frost hardiness development, an intrinsic relationship was found between photosynthetic capacity and the level of fall frost hardiness. The correlation was particularly strong for paper birch (r=-0.77) and less strong for Sitka alder (r=-0.60). Mean population biomass accumulation decreased with increased climate coldness. These patterns may be consequential for evaluation of the impact of climate change and extension of the growing season on plant communities.

AB To evaluate relationships among populations, phenotypic variation of morphological characters in one Gutierrezia microcephala and eight Gutierrezia sarothrae populations from New Mexico was quantified and compared with variation expressed when these same populations were grown in a common garden. During flowering, plants were randomly collected from each population across New Mexico during two growing seasons. A common garden of stem cuttings from these same populations was established in Las Cruces. Vegetative and reproductive characters were measured for each population at original and common sites. Vegetative characters did not differ between G. sarothrae and G. microcephala collected from the same location; however, reproductive characters were dissimilar between these two species. Vegetative and reproductive characters differed among G. sarothrae populations at original and common sites between years, although certain populations clustered. Based on morphological characters, more populations clustered when collected from original sites compared to when grown at the common site. Genetics and environment both played a role in the expression of G. sarothrae phenotype when measuring morphological characters; however, G. sarothrae genotypes maintained their general population phenotype expressed at original sites when grown in the common site. Apparently, vegetative and reproductive characters are fairly stable, and the Gutierrezia genotype has more influence on resulting phenotype than the environment in which it grows.

AB Virtually all plant parts rotate slightly about a central axis, a movement called circumnutation, but vines show exaggerated circumnutation. This study contrasts circumnutation in two congeneric twining vines, specifically focusing on differences in erect and prostrate shoots, and examines the impact of circumnutation on exploitation of available climbing supports and exploration for more distant ones. Elongating shoots of Lonicera japonica and L. sempervirens growing in a common garden were classed as (1) erect bur not climbing, (2) climbing on a trellis, or (3) prostrate, and their circumnutation quantified by tracking the compass direction of shoot tips. To quantify the impact of different circumnutation behaviors, the climbing success of erect shoots and the: maximum dispersion and rooting success of prostrate shoots were measured. Erect shoots of both species circumnutated at similar rates (averaging 31 degrees/h), and did not differ in their success rate of exploiting trellises (averaging 76.8%). prostrate shoots differed,with those produced by L. japonica having reduced circumnutation. In contrast, prostrate shoots of L. sempervirens continued to circumnutatr as much as erect shoots. The specialized circumnutation behavior of the prostrate shoots of L. japonica results in increased rooting success and maximum dispersion compared to the unspecialized shoots of L. sempervirens.

AB Seeds of Purshia tridentata, a shrub of semi-arid North America, require chilling to become non-dormant. Using seeds produced from controlled crosses in a common garden, we examined effects of ovule parent, pollen parent, and year of production on germination percentage in response to chilling for 2 weeks at 2 degrees C. Differences among ovule parents accounted for most of the variance in chilling response, and these differences (2 to 83% germination) were consistent across years. Differences among pollen parents were also significant, producing a two- to five-fold difference in mean germination percentage. Differences among years were significant but small. Ovule parent by par interactions Showed that among-year variation in ripening environment did not affect ovule parents equally. There was no significant pollen parent by year interaction, suggesting that the effect of maturation environment was mediated through maternal tissues. In reciprocal crosses, two plants that showed contrasting dormancy levels as ovule parents produced seeds with similar dormancy as pollen parents, indicating that the genetic difference between them was at the testa level. Two plants that produced seeds with contrasting dormancy as pollen parents showed a similar but stronger pattern of contrast as ovule parents, showing that the genetic difference between them was at both embryo and endosperm or testa level. Testa or endosperm genotype was primarily responsible for chilling response of intact seeds, while embryo genotype affected chilling response and also exercised primary control over low temperature germination rate, whether of excised embryos or of intact seeds.

AB Field samples of bryophytes are highly variable in carbon isotope discrimination values (Delta a measure of (CO2)-C-13 uptake relative to (CO2)-C-12), but it is unknown what affects Delta under field conditions, or how variation in Delta relates to bryophyte performance. This study employed field and greenhouse common garden studies to evaluate the influence of microsite, seasonal, and genetic variation on Delta in peatmosses. Three species of Sphagnum that occupy hollow (S. recurvum), carpet (S. palustre), and hummock (S. tenerum) habitats were sampled for relative growth rates (RGR), C:N ratio, and Delta throughout a growing season. Values of Delta ranged from 19.0 to 27.1 parts per thousand. This variation was unrelated to species (P=0.61). However, Delta varied seasonally (P<0.001), with lower discrimination in the spring (mean 22.5 parts per thousand), followed by summer (23.8 parts per thousand) and winter (24.7 parts per thousand). There was also significant microsite variation (P=0.015) which disappeared when plants were grown in a common garden. In both spring and summer, microsite variation in Delta was inversely related to RGR (P<0.001), bur unrelated to C:N ratios (P>0.08). These results suggest that environmental, not genetic, variation at microsites affects Delta in non-vascular plants. However, environmental control of Delta is unlike that in vascular plants where water limitation lowers chloroplastic demand and increases resistance to carbon uptake. In non-vascular plants, water limitation lowers chloroplastic demand and decreases resistance to carbon uptake. These processes have additive effects and generate high spatial and seasonal variability in Delta.

AB In this paper, I investigate whether the presence or absence of anthocyanin is neutral with respect to reproduction in Datura stramonium. The observations concern the portion of the life cycle spanning pollination to germination. Pollinators do not appear to distinguish between floral morphs, as revealed by nonbiased distribution of fluorescent powder used as a pollen analogue. Pollen-tube growth is also equal for the two morphs. Seed germination is affected by the presence of anthocyanin, but apparently only by the genotype of the mother at the anthocyanin locus, and not by the genotype of the embryo itself. In addition. there was an interaction between maternal morph and the maternal source population, with seeds from high-elevation anthocyanin-producing mothers germinating most rapidly and seeds from low-elevation anthocyanin-producing mothers germinating most slowly in a common garden at low elevation. However, because germination of anthocyanin-producing and anthocyaninless progeny proceed equally quickly, the anthocyanin marker provides unbiased estimates of outcrossing rates. The results overall support the use of anthocyanin as a neutral marker, with the alternate phenotypes unlikely to be differentially impacted by the processes of pollination, pollen-tube growth, and germination. Fluctuating selection on conditions for dormancy release may be partially responsible for the maintenance of the anthocyanin polymorphism in Datura stramonium.

   (Euphorbiaceae) are not due to environmental sex determination

AB At Arapaho Prairie, in the sandhills of western Nebraska, the dioecious annual Croton texensis (Euphorbiaceae) exhibits biased sex ratios. Moreover, the direction of bias changes from year to year: in 1994 the study population was significantly female biased, in 1995 and 1996 it was significantly male biased, and in 1997 and 1998 the sex ratio did not differ from 1:1. Such variation in the observed sex ratio in plants is frequently attributed to environmental sex determination (ESD), which is favored by natural selection ii the rare of fitness gain across an environmental gradient is greater for one sex than the other. We performed experiments to determine: (1) whether variation in the sex ratio is correlated with environmental conditions, as would be expected if ESD is operating, and (2) whether ESD, if present, would be favored by natural selection. In a common garden experiment in which water and fertilizes were manipulated the sex ratio was marginally male biased in treatments in which water was added, but not different from 1:1 in other treatments. In field plots into which seeds were planted none of several soil characteristics, nor overall plot quality for C. texensis (measured as average plant biomass) were correlated with plot sex ratio. However, plots in which a large number of planted seeds emerged tended to be female biased. These results provide very weak evidence for sex ratio bias across an environmental gradient, and thus provide little evidence for ESD. Moreover, sex-by-environment interactions for fitness, which are required for the evolution of ESD, were absent for all measured variables. Thus, ESD does not appear to be favored by natural selection in this population. Instead, these biases may have been caused by differences between the sexes in germination and/or early mortality.

AB The salt marsh grass Distichlis spicata was regenerated from tissue culture and propagated in a greenhouse. Selected regenerants, along with selections from six wild populations, were grown for two years in a common garden flood-irrigated thrice weekly with tidal creek water. Selected wild and regenerated plants were also planted in a created salt marsh. Significant differences among regenerant and wild population selections were found in several functionally important salt marsh plant characteristics, including potential detritus production, belowground organic matter production, canopy structure, and decomposition rate. A combination of characteristics not found in the wild populations was evident in a regenerated line that exhibited both a high detritus production potential and a high decomposition rate. The amount of variation that occurred among regenerants from one parental line via somaclonal variation was similar to that which occurred among the wild population selections. Results of this study suggest that tissue culture may provide a means of producing marsh grasses with specific characteristics for directing the functional development of newly created salt marshes.

AB Eucalyptus dives Schauer, E. mannifera Mudie, and E. rossii R.Baker & H.G.Smith are sympatric trees that form a canopy functional type in dry sclerophyll forests of south-eastern Australia. Although their ranges broadly overlap, distributions of the three species differ subtly within an abstract environmental space defined by mean annual temperature and precipitation. We used a combination of common environment and field studies to assess the extent to which these eucalypts might respond differentially to environmental conditions and to determine whether distributional differences are related to physiological or morphological attributes of leaves. In three glasshouse experiments, gas exchange characteristics of E. dives and E. rossii seedlings were remarkably similar. However, data indicated that E. rossii makes more efficient use of nutrients and, under some conditions, has higher water-use efficiency than the other species. In five natural stands, there were significant differences among sites and among species for leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content, carbon isotope discrimination, and specific leaf area. Significant site x leaf-variable interactions showed that the species responded differentially to unique site conditions. At four of the five sites, C-13 discrimination was significantly higher in E. mannifera than in the other two species, and it was significantly higher in E. mannifera than in E. rossii at all five sites. Lower water-use efficiency may restrict E. mannifera to sites on the higher end of the precipitation gradient, whereas higher water-use efficiency may give E. rossii an advantage on arid sites. Variation in specific leaf area across sites was greater in E. mannifera and E. rossii than in E. dives; in contrast, E. dives was more variable in 13C discrimination. Greater physiological plasticity could explain why E. dives occupies a broader range of habitats than the other two species. Contrary to expectations, no leaf variable was strongly correlated with the amount of rainfall received at the sites, but C-13 discrimination was negatively related to mean annual radiation received, which may be a better index of water availability. Despite similarities in gas exchange physiology, members of this putative functional type clearly respond differentially to varying environmental conditions, implying that accurate prediction of responses to environmental change would require knowledge of attributes of each species. However, differential responses might contribute to functional stability on a site subjected to environmental variability.

AB We exposed seedlings of 12 Eucalyptus microtheca F. Muell. provenances to well-watered and water-stressed growing conditions in a greenhouse experiment and investigated the effects of drought on various plant properties in the provenances. We found significant variation in total biomass, height, root mass/foliage area ratio, foliage area/stem cross sectional area ratio, specific leaf area (SLA), water-use efficiency (WUE) and carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) among the provenances. The observed inter-provenance variation was more pronounced in the water-stressed treatment than in the well-watered one. Drought increased root mass/foliage area ratio, foliage area/stem cross sectional area ratio, WUE, delta(13)C and decreased total biomass, height, transpiration and SLA. We also analysed relationships between plant properties and climate of native habitats of the provenances and found that most properties were strongly correlated with mean driest quarter rainfall. The correlation was positive for total biomass, height, transpiration and SLA and negative for root mass/foliage area ratio, foliage area/stem cross sectional area ratio, WUE and delta(13)C. Finally, we evaluated the intra-specific variation in foliage area/stem cross sectional area ratio in the context of tree hydraulic architecture: provenances from dry areas and trees grown under drought stress had more foliage per stem area ratio. However, their transpiration and the length of their hydraulic pathway were smaller and therefore the root to leaf water potential gradient might be smaller in these trees.

AB Freezing tolerance was studied in laboratory and field tests using black cottonwood, Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray, clones collected from eight populations within the coastal, montane, and inland regions of the Pacific Northwest. Freezing tolerance varied among different populations and was dependent on growing environment. Clones from coastal populations grown in a coastal common garden (Puyallup, Wash.) had 50% less injury in laboratory tests compared with the same clones grown in an inland common garden (Pullman, Wash.). In contrast, clones from inland populations grown in an inland common garden had 50% less injury in laboratory tests compared with the same clones grown in a coastal common garden. Freezing tolerance also varied between coastal populations. In field tests at the inland common garden, clones from inland and montane populations had less freezing injury compared with clones from coastal populations. Leaves on 50% of the clones with coastal origins were killed by the first fall frosts compared with 25% for clones with inland origins. Subsequently, 50% of the coastal clones exhibited winter injury following the winters of 1993-1994 and 1994-1995 at the inland common garden. Clones from inland populations exhibited little or no winter injury. The specific tissues injured during freezing tests varied among clones. Populus trichocarpa is a species offering considerable variation for selection to local environments, and therefore, the source of material should be an important consideration in hybrid poplar breeding programs.

AB Contrary to the general expectation, the compensatory continuum hypothesis proposes that grazing may not always affect plant performance adversely. Instead, the effects may vary from negative (undercompensation) to positive (overcompensation), depending on the local availability of resources and the intensity of competition experienced by individual plants. We tested this hypothesis in a common garden experiment by growing tall wormseed mustard, Erysimum strictum, under a factorial design involving simulated grazing (0, 10, or 50% of the main stem clipped), supplemental fertilization and below-ground competition. The results supported the hypothesis. On an average, fertilization increased and competition decreased plant performance. Overcompensation was only observed among the fertilized plants growing free of competition. Simulated grazing increased seed yield 1.6 (10% clipping) and 1.4 times (50% clipping) as compared to unclipped plants when the plants were grown with fertilization and without competition. In contrast, clipping did not significantly increase seed yield in the plants grown without fertilization and/or with competition. The breakage of apical dominance provides a proximate mechanism of these regrowth responses. This is consistent with the fact that most plants (85%) had an unbranched shoot architecture in our study population. However, it is not clear why E. strictum has a relatively unbranched architecture in natural populations. We briefly discuss the alternative ecological factors - competition for light, adaptation to herbivory and optimal timing of flowering as a bet-hedging strategy in monocarpic plants - which might maintain unbranched architecture in this species.

AB In the framework of phenotypic plasticity, tolerance to browsing can be operationally defined as a norm of reaction comparing plant performance in undamaged and damaged conditions. Genetic variation in tolerance is then indicated by heterogeneity in the slopes of norms of reaction from a population. We investigated field gentian (Gentianella campestris) tolerance to damage in the framework of phenotypic plasticity using a sample of maternal lines from natural populations grown under common garden conditions and randomly split into either a control or an artificial clipping treatment. We found a diversity of tolerance norms of reaction at both the population and family level: the impacts of clipping ranged from poor tolerance (negative slope) to overcompensation (positive slope). We detected heterogeneity in tolerance norms of reaction in four populations. Similarly, we found a variety of plastic architectural responses to clipping and genetic variation in these responses in several populations. Overall, we found that the most tolerant populations were late flowering and also exhibit the greatest plastic increases in node (meristem) production in response to damage. We studied damage-imposed natural selection on plasticity in plant architecture in 10 of the sampled populations. In general, there was strong positive direct selection on final number of nodes for both control and clipped plants. However, the total selection on nodes (direct + indirect selection) within each treatment category depended heavily on the frequency of damage and cross-treatment genetic correlations in node production. In some cases, strong correlated responses to selection across the damage treatment led to total selection against nodes in the more rare environment. This could ultimately lead to the evolution of maladaptive phenotypes in one or both of the treatment categories. These results suggest that tolerance and a variety of architectural responses to damage may evolve by both direct and indirect responses to natural selection. While the present study demonstrates the potential importance of cross-treatment genetic correlations in directing the evolution of tolerance traits, such as branch or node production, we did not find any strong evidence of genetic trade-offs in candidate tolerance traits between undamaged and damaged conditions.

AB A large variation in flowering phenology has been observed among Danish populations of Silene nutans. To test whether this variation is genetically determined, we grew plants from 15 different Danish and one Swedish population in a common garden experiment, and analysed their flowering time. The extreme differences in onset of flowering observed in the field were maintained in the common garden. Most of the populations started within overlapping time periods, but two of them flowered much later, one of them at least one month later than the early populations. At this late time only a few flowers were left on plants from the other populations. Genetic differences in flowering phenology were also found among offspring from crossings within and between two populations from the same region. Genetic variation within these was relatively low, with estimated narrow sense heritabilities of 0.23 and 0.04, respectively. Differences in flowering time between populations were also to some extent co-dominantly inherited, although unexplained reciprocal differences complicated its interpretation. Our results, when compared to others on isozyme divergence, suggest that unknown selective processes have affected the phenology of these populations.

AB Phylogeographic and taxonomic relationships among 54 North Atlantic populations of the snowbed grass genus Phippsia were investigated based on isozymes and genetically based morphological variation. The results support recognition of two distinct species, P. algida and P. concinna, the latter with at least two subspecies. Both of these self-fertilizing arctic pioneer species were genetic allotetraploids almost without intrapopulational variation. The two species showed strikingly different phylogeographies in the North Atlantic region in spite of their similarity in morphology, habitat ecology mating system, and dispersal ecology, and in spite of their present cooccurrence in many geographic areas, sometimes even in the same snowbeds. The same electrophoretic multilocus phenotype was observed in all populations of P. algida, and although this species showed considerable morphological variation, the variation was unstructured geographically Thus, P. algida showed a pattern similar to other arctic species investigated in the North Atlantic region; it has probably dispersed postglacially across the sea barriers among Greenland, Svalbard, Iceland, and Scandinavia. In contrast, P. concinna was virtually fixed for different multilocus phenotypes in the three main geographic areas analyzed (S Norway, Svalbard, Greenland), corresponding to fairly distinct divergence in morphology. This pattern suggests absence of postglacial among-area dispersal of P. concinna in spite of all of its similarities with its congener; it may have immigrated to the North Atlantic from different source areas and/or survived the last glaciation in situ.

AB Developmental instability shown by increased fluctuating asymmetry can be caused by either genetic or environmental stress. Genomic coadaptation and heterozygosity are the genetic factors that are commonly assumed to increase the level of developmental stability. Therefore, in hybrid populations the level of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be lower due to higher heterozygosity or higher due to disruption of coadapted gene complexes, depending on the degree of divergence between hybridizing taxa. Here I present data on FA in petals from hybrids between Lychnis viscaria (Caryophyllaceae) and Lychnis alpina and from parental species grown in a common garden environment. Petal asymmetry of hybrids was clearly higher than that of either parental species grown in common environment. Between the two parental species petal asymmetry did not differ. The mean size of the petals in hybrids was about the same as in L. viscaria, thus indicating no heterotic effect. Therefore, it seems that hybrids between L. viscaria and L. alpina do suffer from the disruption of coadapted gene complexes as indicated by higher developmental instability.

AB Male dimorphisms are particularly conspicuous examples of alternative reproductive strategies. The male forceps length dimorphism in the European earwig Forficula auricularia has long been considered an example of a status- (body size) dependent male dimorphism. In this paper, I test three hypotheses relating to the dimorphism of F. auricularia. First, that the dimorphism is status dependent and determined by nutrition. Second, that the dimorphism is a density-dependent adaptation. Third, that there is a genetic basis to population differences in morph frequency seen in the field. These hypotheses were tested by rearing two populations in a split-family rearing design with two diets and two densities. Populations of male earwigs reared in the common garden differed in forceps length and relative forceps length. The populations also differed in the morph frequencies, with 40 versus 26% long-forceped males, These results confirm the notion that there is a genotype-by-environment interaction that determines the morph frequency in a population. There were only minor effects of density on male forceps length and no influence of density on the male dimorphism. In accordance with the hypothesis that the morphs are status-dependent alternatives, large-forceped males only arose on the high-protein diet that produced earwigs of a large body size. However, not all large males produced the long-forceped phenotype. I put forward an extension of the status-dependent dimorphism model that may account for the pattern of forceps dimorphism in this species.

AB Ecologists often assume that the evolutionary response to an environmental gradient will be the same as the phenotypic response. However, under some circumstances the evolutionary response to a gradient may be opposite of the ecological response, a phenomenon known as "countergradient variation." We had previously predicted that counter-gradient selection has occurred in pumpkinseed sunfish in response to a resource gradient created by competition with bluegill sunfish. Because competition only occurs when pumpkinseed are small, rapid growth has evolved to allow passage through the competing size classes as quickly as possible. We performed a common-garden experiment using juvenile pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill and from lakes without bluegill. Pumpkinseed were raised in cages without bluegill, or with a low density of bluegill, or with a high density of bluegill. Bluegill significantly decreased growth for all pumpkinseed, following the predicted ecological gradient. However, pumpkinseed derived from lakes with bluegill grew faster than those from lakes without bluegill under all treatments, following the predicted evolutionary response.

AB The Alaskan endemic shrub Dryas octopetala ssp. alaskensis and its circumpolar conspecific ssp. octopetala are adapted to closely adjacent habitats in alpine areas of Alaska. These alpine areas form geographically disjunct "islands" among which there are limited opportunities for gene flow. Allozyme electrophoresis and a common garden experiment were used to examine genetic variation between subspecies and among disjunct populations of each subspecies. Overall, allozyme variation in D. octopetala is low with little differentiation among populations or between subspecies. Morphological differences, however, are greater between subspecies than among populations within subspecies. Divergence for a few morpho logical and life-history characters has apparently occurred in response to strong selection, but without divergence at allozyme loci. The ancestors of both subspecies of D. octopetala in Alaska were isolated during the Pleistocene in the glacial refugia of Alaska and Yukon, which may explain low overall variation. Dryas. o. alaskensis is thought to be a Pleistocene derivative of ssp. octopetala, which may account for the low allozyme divergence between subspecies. Recent restriction to alpine areas may explain the low differentiation among disjunct populations.

AB We investigated the functional and structural responses of Scots pine to climate and estimated the importance of the genotype on the traits studied. We analysed C-13 isotope discrimination (Delta(13)C) of various provenances in a common garden experiment and gas exchange characteristics for provenances growing in their natural environment. No clear climatic trend was found in the foliar Delta(13)C values of common garden trees. Similar results were obtained from estimation of lambda (a largely VPD, temperature and light independent measure of intrinsic water use efficiency) from the gas exchange data. The ratio of needle mass to unit stem area and branch area to stem area increased towards south in both experiments and hence, seemed to be genetic. Trees from drier and warmer conditions seemed not to have either lower needle mass or higher intrinsic water use efficiency compared to northern latitudes.

AB Biochemical and gene expression changes in response to elevated atmospheric CO2 were investigated in five maternal half-sibling breeding families of Ponderosa pine. Seedlings were grown in a common garden located at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, in open-topped chambers (OTC) for two years. Chamber atmospheres were maintained at ambient, ambient + 175 mu L L-1, CO2, or ambient + 350 mu L L-1CO2. Growth measurements showed significant increases in stem volumes and volume enhancement ratios in three of the five families studied when grown under elevated CO2. Biochemical and gene expression studies were undertaken to gain a mechanistic understanding of these phenotypic responses. Biochemical studies focused on sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) specific activities at increase CO2 levels. Kinetic evaluations of SPS showed an increase in V-Max. Specific SPS probes revealed increases in the transcriptional levels of one SPS gene with exposure to increasing CO2. RT-PCR differential gene displays showed that overall only a small fraction of visualized gene transcripts responded to elevated CO2 (8-10%). There were also significant differences between the gene expression patterns of the different families, some of which correlated with alterations in growth at elevated CO2 levels.

AB Carpobrotus edulis (L.) N. E. Br., an exotic perennial that invades the coastal habitats of California, hybridizes with the presumed native Carpobrotus chilensis (Mol.) N. E. Br. To investigate the potential role of hybrids in the invasion process by C. edulis, we compared the growth and plasticity of clones of hybrids and parental species. Ramets of three hybrid classes and both parental species were grown in a common garden with four different environments. Both the parental species and the hybrids exhibited strong plastic responses to the test environments for characters describing clonal growth and physiology. Carpobrotus edulis consistently had the largest biomass, but C. chilensis produced longer branches. Carbon isotope ratios (partial derivative(13)C) showed only weak differences among morphotypes. Hybrids were mostly intermediate relative to parental species in both growth and physiological characters. The intermediacy of hybrids in their response to environmental variation indicates that they do not have inferior growth compared with parental species. The high amount of plasticity of the hybrids and C. edulis, as well as their overall similarity, may account for their invasion success in different habitats of coastal California.

AB Three subspecies of Artemisia tridentata occupy distinct habitats in the Great Basin of North America: ssp. wyomingensis in low, arid elevations; sap. vaseyana in high, mesic elevations; and ssp. tridentata in intermediate zones. We evaluated differences in the drought experienced and drought tolerance among the subspecies. Drought tolerance was measured by two traits: the xylem pressure (Psi(x)) causing xylem cavitation and Psi(x) causing loss of leaf turgor (Psi(tlp)). As expected from habitat, ssp. wyomingensis experienced a more severe summer drought than ssp. vaseyana (minimum Psi(x) = -7.5 MPa and -3.8 MPa, respectively). Despite the large difference in drought exposure, the subspecies exhihibed similar drought responses, including a reduction in transpiration (E) below 0.5 mmol.s(-1).m(-2), a shedding of 60-65% of foliage, and >95% decline in soil-to-leaf hydraulic conductance. The similarity in the drought response was consistent with pronounced differences in Psi(x), causing 50% loss in xylem conductivity by cavitation (Psi(50)). The Psi(50) was -4.9 MPa in ssp. wyomingensis vs. -3.0 MPa in ssp. vaseyana; ssp. tridentata was in termediate (Psi(50) = -3.9 MPa). Differences in cavitation resistance were preserved in a common garden, suggesting that they arose by genetic differentiation. A water transport model indicated that the greater cavitation resistance in ssp. wyomingensis was a necessary adaptation for its more arid habitat, and that the similar restrictions of E among subspecies were required to avoid hydraulic failure. The Psi(tlp) was also lower in ssp. wyomingensis than in ssp. vaseyana. Although Psi(tlp) decreased in both subspecies during drought, the adjustment was not sufficient to maintain turgor. Turgor loss may have been adaptive in minimizing shoot growth and stomatal conductance under hydraulically limiting circumstances.

AB Individual egg mass and fecundity increased with somatic mass in first time and repeat spawning wild anadromous and freshwater resident brown trout Salmo trutta. The egg mass was larger for similar-sized trout in south (58 degrees N) than mid Norway (63 degrees N), whereas fecundity was higher in mid- than in south Norway, making total gonadal investment similar in the two areas. Repeat spawners had heavier eggs than similar-sized first time spawners. The egg mass of residents was c. 10% larger than that of similar-sized first time spawning anadromous trout. Common garden experiments with offspring of wild anadromous trout showed no significant correlation between egg and somatic mass in first time spawners in two of the three populations studied. In the third population, a slight positive correlation was found. Similar results were found for repeat spawners. In the three populations, fecundity increased significantly with somatic mass in both first time and repeat spawners. Wild and hatchery-reared trout showed negative correlation between egg mass and fecundity when the effect of body size was excluded, indicating a trade-off between the two parameters. In wild trout, this was caused by variation among populations, whereas in hatchery fish, within population Variation was observed in egg mass over fecundity. Furthermore, the egg mass of first time and repeat spawners were positively correlated, when adjusted for fish size. Size-specific gonadal investment was significantly higher in wild anadromous than resident trout. There was no significant difference in gonadal investment between first time and repeat spawners in wild anadromous trout. However, in the hatchery-reared trout, gonadal investment was significantly higher at repeat than first time maturation. The hatchery trout did not spawn naturally, but were artificially stripped. Among populations, a part of the variation in egg mass and fecundity is phenotypically plastic, a part appears genetically determined. (C) 1999 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.

AB The frequency and selective impact of deleterious mutations are fundamental parameters in evolutionary theory, yet they have not been directly measured in a plant species, To estimate these quantities, we allowed spontaneous mutations to accumulate for 10 generations in 1,000 inbred lines of the annual, self-fertilizing plant Arabidopsis thaliana and assayed fitness differences between generations 0 and 10 in a common garden. Germination rate, fruit set, and number of seeds per fruit each declined by less than 1% per generation in the mutation lines, and total fitness declined by 0.9% per generation. Among-line variances increased in the mutation lines for all traits. Application of an equal-effects model suggests a downwardly biased genomic deleterious mutation rate of 0.1 and a upwardly biased effect of individual mutations on total fitness of 20%. This genomic deleterious mutation rate is consistent with estimates of nucleotide substitution rates in flowering plants, the genome size of Arabidopsis, and the equilibrium inbreeding depression observed in this highly selfing plant species.

AB Populations of the high-Andean frog Hyla labialis show prolonged breeding activity of fluctuating intensity over most of the year. For this reason, tadpoles and metamorphosing frogs can be found in a given pond during all months of the year. On 45 field days distributed over 32 months, we captured, marked, and released 1022 metamorphosing frogs at a single breeding pond, and we recorded their abundance and mean body size over time. The largest metamorphosing frogs emerged during and immediately after months with many hours of sunshine. We also recorded breeding activity and body size of adult frogs resulting from individually marked and recaptured metamorphosing frogs. The percentage of recaptured individuals, our estimate of juvenile survival, did not correlate with monthly averaged metamorphic size. Adult body size of 17 recaptured males was positively correlated with metamorphic size once the effect of postmetamorphic age was statistically removed. In order to test whether the intrapond variation in metamorphic size affects the adult phenotype, we reared 58 individuals in the laboratory under common garden conditions. We found that larger male metamorphosing frogs attained sexual maturity sooner but at similar body sizes than smaller metamorphs. Our results suggest that the maturation and adult phenotypes of males of H. labialis are at least partially determined by metamorphic size.

AB In eastern North America, body size of the larval ant lion Myrmeleon immaculatus increases from south to north, following Bergmann's rule. We used a common-garden experiment and a reciprocal-transplant experiment to evaluate the effects of food and temperature on ant lion growth, body size, and survivorship. In the laboratory common-garden experiment, first-instar larvae from two southern (Georgia, South Carolina) and two northern (Connecticut, Rhode Island) populations were reared in incubators under high- and low-food and high- and low-temperature regimes. For all populations, high food increased final body mass and growth rate and decreased development time. Growth rates were higher at low temperatures, but temperature did not affect larval or adult body mass. Survivorship was highest in high-food and low-temperature treatments. Across all food and temperature treatments, northern populations exhibited a larger final body mass, shorter development time, faster growth rate, and greater survivorship than did southern populations. Results were similar for a field reciprocal-transplant experiment of third-instar larvae between populations in Connecticut and Oklahoma: Connecticut larvae grew faster than Oklahoma larvae, regardless of transplant site. Conversely, larvae transplanted to Oklahoma grew faster than larvae transplanted to Connecticut, regardless of population source. These results suggest that variation in food availability, not temperature, may account for differences in growth and body size of northern and southern ant lions. Although northern larvae grew faster and reached a larger body size in both experiments, northern environments should suppress growth because of reduced food availability and a limited growing season. This study provides the first example of countergradient selection causing Bergmann's rule in an ectotherm.

AB Two leaf-feeding caterpillars, western tussock moth (Orgyia vetusta) and ranchman's tiger moth (Platyprepia virginalis) are abundant on Lupinus arboreus along the California coast. Previous experiments and observations suggested that feeding caused by either of these two folivores could reduce the performance and possibly the abundance and distribution of the other species. Previous common garden experiments also indicated that genetically determined characteristics of the host plants were important for O. vetusta. Here we examined the effects of familial origin of the host plant, and previous damage caused by O. vetusta on the abundance of P. virginalis. Plants with parents from one of three locations had higher numbers of P. virginalis than plants with parents from the other two locations. However, this effect of plant origin depended on the statistical analysis and was not as strong as the effect of prior damage by O. vetusta on numbers of P. virginalis. Counter to our expectation. bushes that supported higher levels of damage by O. vetusta in the previous summer had more P. virginalis caterpillars. This strong effect could result by both moth species selecting bushes with the same traits or as the result of herbivory by O. vetusta enhancing the susceptibility of bushes for P. virginalis.

AB Carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C) is,useful surrogate for integrated, plant water-use efficiency (WUE) when measured on plants grown in a common environment. In a variety of species, genetic variation in delta(13)C has been linked to the distribution of genotypes across gradients in atmospheric and soil water. We examined genetic variation for delta(13)C in seedlings of honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), an invasive grassland shrub that thrives in the southwestern USA. Fifteen maternal families, representing progeny of 15 adult trees, were studied in three common garden experiments in a greenhouse. The 990-km east-west transect along which the adult trees were located encompasses a wide precipitation gradient, and includes mesic grassland, semiarid grassland, and Chihuahuan desert ecosystems. Genetic variation for delta(13)C in mesquite was substantial, with the rank order of half-sib families based on delta(13)C relatively stable across experiments, which were conducted under different environmental conditions. Conversely, rankings of families by mean seedling height (an index of growth rate) varied markedly among experiments. Seedlings derived from Chihuahuan desert adults emerged more quickly and had more negative delta(13)C (indicative of lower WUE) than seedlings derived from the other regions. Although delta(13)C and seedling height were not correlated, these results suggest that mesquite genotypes at the drier, western extreme of the species' range are adapted for quicker emergence and possibly faster growth than genotypes from mesic areas. Together, these traits may facilitate exploitation of infrequent precipitation events.

AB The performance of gypsy moths (Lymantria dispar) feeding on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) is strongly influenced by host foliar chemistry and susceptibility to a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (LdNPV), but the relationship of susceptibility to chemistry is poorly understood. We investigated the effects of genetic and resource-mediated variation in phytochemistry on viral pathogenicity. Trees were grown in pots in a common garden. Disks were punched from aspen leaves, inoculated with LdNPV and fed to third instars. Additional leaves were analyzed for levels of nitrogen, starch, phenolic glycosides, and condensed tannins. Despite marked variation among trees in levels of phenolic glycosides and tannins, we observed minimal variation in larval susceptibility to LdNPV. Viral pathogenicity was only weakly (inversely) correlated with tannin concentrations in one of two experiments. These results suggest that differential defoliation of aspen by gypsy moths in the field is due to the direct effects of host chemistry on larval performance rather than to the indirect effects of host chemistry on efficacy of this natural enemy.

AB The systematics and genetic structure of taxa representing the Ponderosae subsection of genus Pinus were assessed for disjunct, isolated, and peripheral populations occupying the mountain islands of the Southwest. Wind-pollinated progenies of 290 trees were compared in common gardens according to ten variables reflecting allometric, needle, and phenologic characteristics of 2-yr-old trees. The tests also included populations of similar taxa from the Rocky Mountains to the north and the Sierra Madre to the south. Principal component and canonical discriminant analyses demonstrated that the taxa segregated into three distinct groups, one of which contained two subgroups. These groupings collectively accounted for all of the many and confusing taxonomic descriptions that exist for the Ponderosae of the southwest United States and northern Mexico. The results suggested that intertaxa hybrids or hybrid derivatives may have been segregating within the propenies of only three of the parental trees. Hybridization, therefore, appears to be infrequent and inconsequential to the interrelationships among taxa and to contemporary genetic structures of taxa. Univariate analyses showed that the three distinct groups displayed different genetic structures despite similarities in their geographic distributions. While genetic variation within populations of all groups was abundant, a group labeled 'quinquefoliata" displayed little variation among populations; one labeled "engelmannii" had abundant interpopulation variation that was largely randomly distributed across the landscape; and in a group containing the subgroups called "scopulorum" and "taxon X," abundant interpopulation variability was arranged systematically along moderately steep dines. These disparate genetic structures showed no apparent effects of the isolated, disjunct, and peripheral conditions under which populations of these taxa exist.

TI Translocations and rapid evolutionary responses in recently established
   populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis)
SO ANIMAL CONSERVATION
LA English
DT Article
AB The response of quantitative traits in translocated populations has not been well explored. Evolutionary shifts in quantitative traits, such as life history characteristics, are of particular interest because of their obvious association with fitness. In a recent survey, Stockwell (1995) examined life history variation of four populations of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) that were derived from a common ancestral population 55-58 years earlier. Three life history traits differed considerably among the four sites and appeared to be correlated with local environmental conditions. To test whether these differences were due to plasticity or rapid evolution, fish from the four sites were maintained under common-garden conditions for two generations. After two generations a genetic basis was inferred for two of the three traits (size at maturity and fat content), but not for the third trait (offspring size). Thus, rapid evolution had occurred for two life history traits in these recently established populations. This case of rapid life history evolution may be due to genetic drift and/or natural selection. These data suggest that translocations may lead to rapid evolutionary responses of targeted taxa. Rapid evolutionary responses are of special concern for 'refuge' populations that are maintained as a hedge against extinction.

AB This article documents the differentiation among populations for quantitative traits and for achene morph proportions in the heterocarpic species Crepis sancta (Asteraccae). The descendants of plants from three populations from northeastern France, two northwestern populations, and three southern populations were compared in a common garden experiment in the south of France. Phenological characters, such as age at reproduction, and some fitness-related traits (seedling size, fecundity of head) showed genetic differentiation among the three population groups that can be considered as an adaptive pattern. In contrast, there was no consistent difference among regions or populations in achene morph proportions. Developmental constraints occurring during the ontogeny of the capitulum lead to some allometric relationships between head traits. In particular, within a head, the number of peripheral achenes cannot be as variable as the number of central achenes. However, these constraints do not explain the reduced variation in achene morph proportions observed in C. sancta. Therefore, the reproductive system of C. sancta-insect pollinated and highly allogamous-should contribute to the observed patterns by constraining capitulum size. Finally, since achene morphs differ for their dispersal and competitive ability, this result could be related to the colonizing aptitude of the species.

AB Four highly differentiated chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) lineages were identified in the forest tree species Eucalyptus globulus Labill. (Myrtaceae) in Australia using restriction site polymorphisms from Southern analysis. The cpDNA variation did not conform with ssp. boundaries, yet there was a strong geographical pattern to the distribution of the lineages. One lineage (C) was geographically central and widespread, whereas the other three lineages were found in peripheral populations: Western (W), Northern (N) and Southern (S). Thirteen haplotypes were detected in E. globulus, seven of which belonged to clade C. At least three of the cpDNA lineages (C, N and S) were shared extensively with other species. On the east coast of the island of Tasmania, there was a major north-south difference in cpDNA in the virtually continuous distribution of E. globulus. Northern populations harboured haplotypes from clade C while southeastern populations harboured a single haplotype from clade S. This difference was also reflected in several co-occurring endemic species. It is argued that the extensive cpDNA differentiation within E. globulus is likely to originate from interspecific hybridization and 'chloroplast capture' from different species in different parts of its range. Superficially, this hybridization is not evident in taxonomic traits; however, large-scale common garden experiments have revealed a steep dine in quantitative genetic variation that coincides with the haplotype transition in Tasmania. Our cpDNA results provide the strongest evidence to date that hybridization has had a widespread impact on a eucalypt species and indicate that reticulate evolution may be occurring on an unappreciated scale in Eucalyptus.

AB Analyses of resistance of hybrid plants to herbivores in natural populations have revealed a diversity of patterns, including hybrid susceptibility, hybrid dominance, and hybrid intermediacy. But because many of these studies are conducted on unknown genotypes of hybrid plants in natural habitats, the genetic and environmental causes of the patterns cannot be distinguished. Predicted patterns and models of underlying genetic and environmental causes of these patterns are presented for F(1), F(2), and BC hybrid genotypes, It is argued that progress in resolving the causal relationships in hybrid plant-herbivore interactions will require experimentation that compares known hybrid genotypes in a combination of common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. Such experiments will also permit tests of genotype-by-environment interactions in hybrid resistance that parallel hypotheses of hybrid plant fitness in hybrid zones.

AB Colonies of the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri (a cyclical hermaphrodite) exhibit extreme variability in egg production, and there is a large genetic component to this phenotypic variation. Therefore, the developmental bases of variation among different genotypes was investigated. Colonies differing in egg production (assayed as number of eggs per asexual bud) were cultured in a common garden experiment, and buds were collected and fixed early in the reproductive cycle. The buds were serially sectioned, and the number and size of the oocytes in the developing ovaries were determined for the different genotypes. Because the buds were collected prior to the onset of vitellogenesis, they contained oocytes at the three previtellogenic stages. In reproductive colonies (>0.7 eggs per bud), there were negative relationships between the final number of eggs per bud and (1) the total number of oocytes present, (2) the number of stage I oocytes present, and (3) the number of stage 2 oocytes present. There was no relationship between these parameters in nonreproductive colonies (<0.3 eggs per bud). In contrast, the number of stage 3 oocytes per bud was positively correlated with the final number of eggs per bud in both reproductive and nonreproductive colonies. In reproductive animals there was a negative relationship between the total number of oocytes per bud and the percentage of oocytes at stage 3 in oogenesis. A principal component analysis revealed that a single vector equally weighted for the number of eggs per bud, the total number of oocytes per bud, and the percentage of oocytes at stage 3 accounted for 84% of the observed variation in reproductive colonies. These data indicate that the phenotypic variation in egg production among the B. schlosseri colonies in the Damariscotta River, Maine, is controlled by genetic variation in both the number of oocytes that populate developing ovaries, and the percentage of oocytes that reach stage 3 in oogenesis.

AB 1. The gall midge, Asphondylia borrichiae, attacks the terminals of three plants in the aster family: Borrichia frutescens, Iva frutescens, and I. imbricata.
   2. In the field, Borrichia suffers the highest rate of galling and I. imbricata the lowest. Common garden experiments also revealed highly significant differences in the attack rates of the three host species by Asphondylia. However, these differences depended on the source of the attacking midge population.
   3. Midges collected from Borrichia and I. frutescens attacked the host in which they developed almost exclusively, whereas those from I. imbricata attacked both Iva spp.
   4. Each Asphondylia larva develops in its own chamber within a gall. Borrichia galls were 2.5-3.5-fold less crowded than those from I. imbricata and I. frutescens, respectively. Consequently, midges that developed in Borrichia were significantly larger and eclosed with 30-40% more eggs than those that developed in I. imbricata and I. frutescens, respectively.
   5. Although performance of Asphondylia larvae was lowest on the two Iva spp., especially I. frutescens, these hosts may provide an escape from natural enemies as a trade-off for reduced offspring performance.
   6. Differences in host-plant species phenology may reduce gene flow among host-associated populations of Asphondylia, thereby favouring the formation of races at the level of plant genus.

AB The germination characteristics of European provenances of seven weed and grassland species which are used in agricultural compensation sites in Switzerland for example on set-asides, were investigated along a W-E gradient (England, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary). In,growth chambers the germination increment with temperature was different among the four main species and provenances tested. Consistently the English provenances were least responsive. The germination rate of Silene alba increased most strongly with temperature, Daucus carota and Leucanthemum vulgare were intermediate, whereas Centaurea cyanus showed the lowest response to temperature. Germination of Daucus was enhanced by alternating temperatures, and this effect was significantly higher for the most distant provenances compared with the Swiss seeds. Also in Leucanthermum and Silene the foreign provenances showed a stronger effect of alternating temperatures, whereas seeds of Centaurea were not affected. In a common garden experiment Cichorium intybus, Daucus Leucanthemum and Silence, but not Centaurea, revealed a trend towards lower germination with increasing distance of the provenance. Germination phenology of the different provenances varied in the above species and in Hypericum perforatum, except the arable weeds Centaurea and Papaver rhoeas. A principle component analysis confirmed that the overall variability among provenances was lowest in Centaurea, intermediate in Daucus and Leucanthemum, and highest in Silene. The results suggest provenance-specific adaptations which were partly correlated with the climate along the European gradient tested. Such adaptations can be used as an argument against the introduction of foreign seeds for ecological compensation sites. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.All rights reserved.

AB The heterogenous structure of eastern deciduous forest canopies creates an understory light continuum ranging from deep shade to extended periods of direct solar irradiance below large canopy gaps. We designed an experiment to explore how shagbark hickory (Carya ovata (Mill.) K. Koch; Juglandaceae) seedlings respond to changes in both the total amount of available light and the durations of experimental sun patches. Seedlings were grown in a common garden under shadehouses where they experienced one of two light levels (high vs. low light), one of two sun patch durations (short vs. long duration) and 100% light (control). Over the growing season, seedlings responded morphologically to the amount of available light by changes in mean stem height, weight, basal diameter, specific leaf mass, chlorophyll content, taproot length, primary and secondary root weight and root ash weight. Chlorophyll content and stem height were negatively related to the amount of available light whereas the other morphological characters were positively related to increased amounts of light. Changes in the duration of experimental sun patches significantly affected stem biomass, basal diameter, secondary root dry weight and root ash weight independent of total light amount. Though the effects of sun patch duration were not as pronounced as those found for amount of light, our results demonstrate the importance of including periods of direct light in experimental designs involving responses of seedlings to varying light regimes. The ecological responses of many hardwoods, especially those of midshade tolerance, to the middle portion of the gap-understory continuum remain poorly studied.

AB Interspecific hybridization can disrupt normal resistance of plant and animal species to their parasites. Resistance to parasites is affected by hybridization in the following ways: no difference between hybrids and parentals, additivity, hybrid susceptibility, and dominance to susceptibility. Similar patterns were seen across host taxa. Responses of different parasite species vary widely to the same hybrid host, which indicates diverse genetic effects of interspecific hybridization on resistance. Differences between field and common garden or laboratory studies suggest that environmental factors in hybrid zones influence the patterns seen in the field. Based on recent studies of hybrid-parasite interactions, three avenues of future research will provide a more complete understanding of the roles of hybrids and the roles of parasites in host evolution. First, the relationship between inheritance of putative resistance mechanisms of hosts and responses of parasites needs study using analyses of recombinant progenies. Second, the interaction among environmental variation in hybrid zones, resistance mechanisms, responses of parasites, and the impact of parasites on host fitness needs experimental analysis using reciprocal transplant experiments in hybrid zones. Finally, the role of hybrids in the community structure and interactions of parasites needs study.

AB I raised juvenile chuckwallas (Sauromalus obesus; Iguanidae) that were collected from six different populations under identical conditions in a laboratory common-garden experiment. This experiment allows partitioning of genetic causes from environmental causes of the differences in adult size found in different populations. Chuckwallas from different home populations showed what appear to be genetic differences in size and patterns of growth. Lizards from populations with small adults grew faster before maturity and slower after maturity than those from populations with larger adults. Size and growth rates were correlated with elevation among sites for chuckwallas both raised in the laboratory and in natural populations. For example, at low-elevation sites, chuckwallas grew comparatively rapidly to reach maturity in a shortened growing season. A high frequency of drought at these hot, dry sites may necessitate storage of energy after maturity as a buffer against the relatively high probability that food will be limited in the following year. Lizards at higher elevation sites, however, are freed from this constraint, allowing them to use energy for growth to reach larger size and therefore to produce larger clutches. Although plant species diversity in the wild showed an increase with increasing elevation, food abundance, measured as the aboveground biomass of annuals, did not. This indicates that the length of time food is available, rather than its abundance, is of primary importance to chuckwallas.

AB It is generally recognized that plants are genetically adapted to prevailing climate. However, there are very few genecological studies that quantify these relationships. Planting stock is often moved across environmental gradients with little knowledge of the ecological risks. For long-lived species (e.g. forest trees) this introduces risks of increased mortality, lowered potential growth rates, and increased susceptibility to insects and diseases. Seedwhere is a computer-based tool to support decisions on moving plant material across environmental gradients. The Cower similarity metric has been invoked as an Avenue extension in the ARCVIEW Geographic Information System. The program can be used to map the similarity of potential seed collection sites across large regions, Considerable effort has gone into developing the required GIS database for the Great Lakes region of North America. Such data are becoming increasingly available in many parts of the world. Some example applications of Seedwhere are provided for the Great Lakes region. While no panacea for this complex and large problem, the seedwhere tool provides a quantitative approach to visualizing the issue that should help resource managers. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

SO EUPHYTICA

DT Article
DE genetic resources; legumes; perennial grains; new crops
AB Illinois bundleflower, Desmanthus illinoensis (Michaux) MacMillan, is an herbaceous perennial legume native to the central and southeastern USA. It has been identified as a potential perennial grain legume. To describe variation among natural populations for agriculturally desirable characteristics, 141 accessions of D. illinoensis and one of D. leptolobus were evaluated in common garden plantings established in 1988 and 1990. Characteristics showing diversity among populations included seed yield, plant height, growth habit, days to maturity, 100 seed weight, and shatter resistance. Eight characteristics were analyzed by principal components and cluster analysis. The resulting four clusters accounted for 56% of the variation among accessions. One cluster was distinctive in having plants with vigorous, prostrate first year growth, poor winter hardiness, and large seed. Three accessions also had indehiscent legumes useful for breeding shatter resistance. There appears to be sufficient variation to support genetic improvement of agricultural characteristics of Illinois bundleflower.

ID HYM-FORMICIDAE
AB Myrmica rubra is a northern, temperate Palaearctic ant species with a geographical range that extends from the Atlantic coast of Europe to central Asia. In Europe, its range covers > 25 degrees of latitude where it lives under a variety of climates that vary from extreme oceanic in the west, to continental in the east. Colonies nest in the soil and their life cycles are known to be highly dependent on ambient temperature and soil moisture. We hypothesised that the brood-rearing behaviour of populations might be focally adapted to climate and that we might detect differences when the ants were reared under "common-garden" conditions. Brood-rearing behaviour was compared for 38 colonies of M. rubra drawn from 13 populations representing a range of 6 latitudes: all 6 were represented in eastern Europe and 2 in western Europe. A sample of ants from each colony was used to estimate respiration rate, body mass and fat content at the start of the experiment in spring (immediately post hibernation) and at the end of the experiment (mid summer). Respiration had a linear relationship with latitude, with northern populations having greater respiration rate in spring compared to southern populations. It is suggested that this is an adaptation to different seasonality over the species' range that results in the "more active" northern workers rearing fewer brood to maturity more quickly than southern workers. Fat content, a measure of worker "quality", had a parabolic relationship with latitude with mid latitude colonies having the fattest workers. Fatter workers appeared to rear heavier brood. This probably represented a functional response to environment with populations living at "edge of range" sites being physiologically more stressed and performing brood-rearing tasks less well than centre of range populations. We believe that this is the first demonstration of a consistent, intra-specific trend for Variation in the social physiology of an ant species over its geographic range.

AB Pumpkinseed sunfish exhibit considerable intraspecific variation in jaw morphology, with population-level differences in the size of key morphological structures often exceeding 200%. This inter-population variation is correlated with differences in the availability of gastropods, the pumpkinseed's primary prey. Such resource polymorphisms may be an indication of local adaptation to resource conditions. This explanation, however, assumes that the observed phenotypic variation has an underlying genetic basis. Here, we provide evidence from two types of common-garden experiments that variation in pumpkinseed pharyngeal jaw morphology is the result of phenotypic plasticity
   We collected adult fish from two populations (with the greatest observed divergence in morphology and resource use), bred them in similar environments, and then raised their young under two conditions: (1) the laboratory where we controlled diets and fed fish either soft-bodied prey only, or a combination of soft-bodied prey and gastropods; and (2) experimental ponds in which the fish were unconstrained with respect to diet. After 1 year, we analysed the pharyngeal morphology of the fish, focusing on the size of the levator posterior, the primary muscle used to generate the force needed to crush snail shells. In the laboratory, there were no differences in morphology attributable to parental stock under either dietary treatment. In contrast, the addition of snails to the fishes' diets led to a substantial (similar to 230%) increase in levator posterior mass. In the ponds, we observed some slight, and inconsistent, differences between populations with respect to muscle mass. In all cases, the population-level differences were very small compared to the effects of different ponds, or compared to the differences in morphology observed in the laboratory. These results show that the natural variation in pharyngeal morphology between these populations of pumpkinseeds is primarily the result of a plastic response to the environment, rather than a response to selection driven by the environmental differences.

AB The waterstrider Aquarius najas is wingless in Northern Europe, while winged individuals occur frequently in Central and Southern Europe. To test if the latitudinal difference is genetically controlled, we collected mature individuals from 10 different populations and raised their offspring in 'common garden' laboratory conditions. Half of these populations were from southern and the other half from central Finland. Daylength and temperature do influence wing development among other species of waterstriders, and thus we maintained a similar short daylength and warm conditions for all populations. These conditions should be favourable for wing development in general. Among laboratory-bred individuals several winged individuals appeared, and their proportion varied between populations. The relative frequency of winged individuals was highest in the southern populations. Thus, apart from phenotypic plasticity there seems to be some genetic control over the occurrence of wings, and the latitudinal trend coincides with the direction in natural populations over a larger European scale. Overwinter survival in our laboratory conditions was higher among the wingless individuals. The survival cost may explain why the proportion of winged individuals was lower in the northern populations with more extreme overwintering conditions than in the southern ones.

AB Variation in carbon isotope composition (delta(13)C), water-use efficiency (WUE) and biomass productivity were compared among three populations of Eucalyptus microtheca F. Muell. in a greenhouse. Seedlings were maintained under one well-watered (Control, keeping the soil at field capacity) and two different water deficit conditions (Drought stress I, keeping the same soil water content; Drought stress II, keeping the same soil water supply). In each treatment, significant population differences in delta(13)C, WUE, and dry matter accumulation and allocation were detected. A negative correlation between WUE and biomass productivity was detected under control and drought stress I, but a positive correlation under drought stress II. The results suggested that there were different water-use strategies among the populations, the southeastern population with lower WUE may employ a prodigal water-use strategy, whereas the northwestern and central populations with higher WUE may employ a conservative water-use strategy. This knowledge may be useful as criteria for genotype selection within a breeding program for this species.

ID GERMPLASM; ASIA
AB Isozyme variation was studied to determine genetic relationships among 269 cultivars of Dioscorea alata originating from the South Pacific, Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Four polymorphic enzyme systems (MDH, PGI, SkDH, 6PGD) revealed 66 isozyme phenotypes, or zymotypes, each uniquely characterized by the presence or absence of 27 electromorphs. Identical zymotypes were found to be distributed in different geographical areas and vice versa, different zymotypes exist within the same geographic zone. Subsequently, distinct local cultivars from the New Caledonia germplasm collection were rated and 131 morphotypes were identified by 25 morphoagronomic descriptors. Four major groups of morphotypes were identified and compared with the zymotypes of the described accessions. Each of the 131 cultivars was also analysed for the physico-chemical characteristics of the tubers (percent dry matter, percent starch, total minerals, proteins content, polyphenolic compounds, P, K and Ca contents) and three major chemotypic groups were identified. No correlations were found between morphotypes, zymotypes and chemotypes of accessions grown in a common garden. Many cultivars exhibited variation in qualitative traits, such as anthocyan pigmentation, probably as a result of human selection of somatic mutations. The most widespread D. alata cultivars exhibit a narrow genetic base. However, the existing genetic variation is also due to ancient sexual recombinations as demonstrated by the isozyme patterns. Dioscorea alata might be a true species and not a putative cultigen as previously reported.

AB 1 The clonal cactus Opuntia rastrera shows predominantly sexual reproduction in grasslands (GH) and clonal propagation in nopaleras (NH). We assessed the effects of light, herbivory, water availability and the habitat an offspring came from on the survival and growth of sexual or clonal offspring (i.e, seedlings and cladodes), through 3- and 4-year common garden and short-term greenhouse experiments.
   2 Shading by nurse plants increased seedling survival in the held by an order of magnitude, and a small additional advantage due to predator protection by grasses was observed. Strong herbivory transforms a facultative nurse-protege relationship for seedlings into an obligatory one.
   3 In the greenhouse seedlings grew batter under shade, but in the held the production of the first cladode was delayed in seedlings in the more shaded GH, Competition for soil resources may be more intense under a dense grass tussock than under a open shrub, thus affecting the nurse-protege relationship, Seedling survival under nurse plants was similar in GH and NH, but higher plant cover suggests that a larger number of seedlings will establish in GH in the long term,
   4 Cladode survival was higher in NH. Cladodes were more successful than seedlings at establishing in intercanopy areas, possibly due to physiological differences as well as their ability to survive partial predation. Cladode survival in intercanopy areas may explain the enhanced clonal propagation in the more open NH scrubland. together with their susceptibility to the flooding which affects GH.
   5 The high seedling and cladode survival in the greenhouse experiments contrasted with that observed in the field, indicating that survival is determined by the interaction between herbivores, plants and abiotic conditions rather than the physiological aptitude of the plants.

AB A transformation/regeneration system was developed for the common garden Lobelia (Lobelia erinus). Using an Agrobacterium-based protocol, over 40 transformants have been generated with four different binary vectors. The explant source was hypocotyl-root sections from axenically grown seedlings. Stable transformation was demonstrated by Southern hybridization analysis, beta-glucuronidase staining, and transmission of the T-DNA to progeny. This extends the ever-widening range of transformable plant species to the Campanulaceae and will allow molecular studies of development and physiology in this easily cultured and popular garden plant.

AB The independent and interactive effects of light and simulated herbivory on growth and biomass allocation in the endangered emergent sedge, Scirpus ancistrochaetus Schuyler, were examined in a 15-week common garden experiment. Light level was manipulated through the use of shade cloth to attain shading levels of 0%, 30%, 63% and 90%, while herbivory was simulated by reducing plant height by 50% six weeks into the experiment. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) of final total (shoot + root) plant mass, leaf width and root to shoot ratio (R:S) indicated overall significant effects of both light and the interaction of light and clipping. Means of these Variables decreased with decreasing light level. Furthermore, means of these variables were generally higher for clipped plants than unclipped plants in 0% shade, while they tended to be lower in clipped plants in all other levels of shade. Maximum leaf height was also significantly affected by light. Leaf height was similar in all treatments for the first ii weeks. For the last four weeks of the experiment, however, leaf height was lowest in plants grown in 0% shade, highest in plants grown in 63 and 90% shade, and intermediate in plants grown in 30% shade. Clipped plants tended to be taller than unclipped plants at lower levels of shade, while the opposite was true at higher levels of shade, although effects were marginally significant. Both light and the interactive effect of Light and clipping were important determinants of growth of S. ancistrochaetus in this experiment and therefore may be important influences on its distribution within and among pond habitats.

AB Decimation of the California (U.S.A.) prairie has increased interest ill the conservation and ecological restoration of grasslands composed of native perennial species. Widespread plantings are being attempted, and the potential for contaminating existing remnant populations with maladapted germplasm has led to concerns about The use of nonlocal seed sources. We evaluated regional patterns of isozyme and quantitative trait variation in the native perennial grass Nassella pulchra for the purpose of developing recommendations about the spatial scales over which seed can be translocated Seed was collected from 10 remnant native populations Progeny from all 10 populations were scored for isozyme variation with 11 stains, and progeny from 8 populations were planted in a common garden to evaluate variation for 11 quantitative (polygenic) traits. The correspondence between isozyme and quantitative traits variation and the relationships of both types of variation to geographic distance and climate were explored by Mantel test regressions. Populations were strongly differentiated for both isozymes and quantitative traits, but cluster analysis based on each type of data did not result in the same population groupings. This lack of congruence was further demonstrated by the nonsignificance of the regression of Hedrick's distances for isozymes on Mahalanobis distances for quantitative traits Quantitative trait variation was strongly, associated with climatic variables, whereas isozyme variation was not. This suggests that the relative importance of genetic drift and selection in shaping patterns of genetic differentiation may depend upon the type of trait evaluated. Quantitative traits are potentially better indicators of adaptation to regional and local environmental variation, and thus the usefulness of isozymes for making recommendations about the spatial settles over which seed of N. pulchra can be translocated may be limited. Unfortunately, obtaining data on patterns of quantitative traits variation is often time- and labor-intensive. The close association of quantitative trait variation with regional climatic variables indicates that an index based on readily obtainable climatic information might aid restorationists in making rapid decisions about appropriate spatial scales for translocating native grasses.

AB Developmental instability in the form of increased fluctuating asymmetry can be caused by either genetic or environmental stress. Because extinctions can be attributed broadly to these factors, fluctuating asymmetry may provide a sensitive tool for detecting such stresses. We studied the level of fluctuating asymmetry of flowers of a perennial outcrossing plant species, Lychnis viscaria, both in natural and common-garden populations. The degree of flower asymmetry was higher in small, isolated, and marginal populations of the species range. These marginal populations also were the most homozygous. In the core area of the species' range, flowers were more symmetrical. The level of asymmetry was correlated with both population size and heterozygosity. However, a partial correlation analysis revealed that when the impact of population size was controlled for, there was a negative relationship between fluctuating asymmetry and heterozygosity, whereas when controlling for heterozygosity, no relationship between population size and fluctuating asymmetry was found. This indicates that genetic consequences of small population size probably underlie the relationship between the level of asymmetry and population size. Results from a transplantation experiment showed that individuals subjected to a higher environmental stress had an increased level of asymmetry compared to control plants. In the common-garden conditions the level of fluctuating asymmetry did not differ between the central and marginal populations. This suggests that presumably both genetic and environmental factors affected to the higher level of asymmetry among marginal populations compared to central ones. In all, we conclude that even though fluctuating asymmetry seems to be a sensitive tool for detecting stresses, results from studies focusing on only one factor should be interpreted with caution.

AB We measured herbivore abundance on two species of willows (Salix sericea and S. eriocephala) and their interspecific hybrids in two common garden experiments to test alternative hypotheses concerning the genetic effects of hybridization on plant resistance. The first experiment used potted clones of naturally occurring parental and hybrid plants. Purity of parental plants was determined using 20 RAPD markers (pure S. eriocephala had a score of 1.0 and pure S. sericea had a score of 0). The cloned hybrid plants had hybrid scores between 0.40 and 0.60, indicating they were intermediate hybrids and probably had recombinant (F(2)-type) genotypes. The second experiment used potted one-year-old interspecific F(1) progeny and intraspecific progeny from crosses between genetically pure parents. We counted numbers of herbivores on plants after exposure to attack for about 2 months. Herbivore abundance data were analyzed with ANOVA and a priori contrasts were used to test fit of the data to 5 hypotheses (No Difference, Additive, Dominance, Hybrid Susceptibility, or Hybrid Resistance). We found genetic effects of hybridization on susceptibility to some herbivores in both experiments, with the additive, dominance, and hybrid susceptibility hypotheses supported by different herbivore species. There was also significant genetic variation among clones and genotypes within hybrid and parental taxa for herbivore resistance. For several herbivore species we found no difference in the susceptibility among hybrids and parents, which indicates genetic effects of hybridization on resistance were absent for these species. Differences between the hypotheses supported from this study and data from four years of prior field studies suggest that environmental variation is an important factor affecting relative hybrid and parental susceptibility in the field.

AB Fluctuating asymmetry (FA), or random non-directional deviations from perfect symmetry in bilaterally or radially symmetrical traits, has recently been proposed to be a useful indicator of genetic and environmental stress. However, the factors underlying fluctuating asymmetry, especially in plants, remain poorly understood. We sampled leaf fluctuating asymmetry among and within three species of even-aged birch (Betula pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula) and their interspecific hybrids growing in common gardens of northern Finland to determine whether hybridization and environmental stress are associated with increased developmental instability. Our predictions were that: (1) interspecific hybrids among B. pubescens, B. nana, and B. pendula would have enhanced leaf FA compared to the parent groups because of a possible disruption of coadapted genomes; (2) intermediates between Betula pubescens sap. tortuosa and B. pubescens ssp. pubescens would have a slight decrease or no difference in leaf FA compared to the parent group; and (3) fluctuating asymmetry would increase between a low-elevation and a tree-line-elevation site, and this increase would be greater in B. pubescens, which forms the major subarctic community below the tree line, than in B. nana, which is common above the tree line.
   As predicted, leaf FA was higher in the tree-line common garden than in the lower elevation garden, but the amount of increase was not significantly different between B. pubescens and B. nana. Leaf asymmetry was also higher in hybrids than in parental taxa, and this response was fairly consistent among the three crosses. This suggests that interspecific hybridization resulted in higher developmental instability. Furthermore, in the intraspecific studies with B. pubescens, there was no relationship between tree height (an intraspecific hybrid index) and leaf asymmetry. Thus, these data support the ideas of Markow (1995) that the changes in asymmetry observed from hybridization will be a function of how closely related parental taxa are. Since leaf FA in Betula pubescens increased with elevation and hybridization, and both are important in tree-line dynamics, FA might be a useful indicator of stress and distributional limits in this and possibly other plant species.

AB A common-garden study of Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray was established in spring 1986 with 128 clones collected from sites along two mesic (Hoh and Nisqually) and two xeric (Dungeness and Yakima) river valleys in Washington. Two replicate plantation, one in Puyallup and the other in Wenatchee, Wash., were established with this material. Over 2 years data were taken on stem growth, leaf/crown characters, spring/autumn phenology, and the incidence of Melampsora occidentalis leaf rust. Combining clones from all four sources, correlation/regression analyses were used to examine clonal stability of traits between lest sites and trait relationships with stem growth; broad-sense heritabilities (H-2) and genetic correlations revealed the genetic strength of these traits. At Puyallup, many leaf/crown traits predicted stem growth moderately to very well (r(2)>0.50), e.g., total leaf area (TLA) to diameter gave an r(2) of 0.91 and current-terminal leaf size, of 0.79. Some regressions were quadratic, suggesting a threshold level in a trait (e.g., leaf size) beyond which stem growth levels off. Upper-crown TLA was more closely related to height than TLA of the lower sylleptics, but the reverse was true for diameter. A decline in r(2) values from upper to lower crown positions was sharper for correlations of TLAs with height than with diameter. Thus, leaf area al location seems to differentially affect stem growth. When autumn leaf fall (LF) and rust incidence (R) were regressed with growth, r(2) values ranged from 0.58 to 0.71, but those of spring flush (SF)were only 0.10 to 0.12. Early LF and high R, both negatively affecting growth, had a strong geographic component as it occurred mainly on lower-elevation Yakima clones. At Wenatchee, field conditions were harsher and microsites more variable, so trait/growth relationships were weaker. Genetic correlations with growth revealed similar trends as phenotypic analyses. Unlike leaf/crown traits, clonal scores of LF, SE and R were fairly stable across the two test sites (r(2): 0.58-0.80). These traits also showed strong genetic control (H-2: 0.96-0.98). The trait/growth relationships as well as trait stability within clones have implications for selecting clonal stock in poplar culture and conservation.

AB Solidago altissima and S. gigantea were introduced from North America to Europe similar to 250 yr ago and are now considered aggressive weeds in abandoned fields and conservation areas. We studied patterns of genetic differentiation in these two species along their present latitudinal range in Europe (44 degrees-61 degrees N). Two generations of clonally propagated ramets from randomly selected genets of 24 populations of each species were grown in a common-garden experiment at latitude 47 degrees N from 1991 to 1992. Both species showed significant variation among populations in morphological and life-history characters: at this southern location, plants from northern populations were smaller and flowered earlier than plants from southern populations. The gradient of clinal variation was more pronounced in the second year of cultivation than in the first and was steeper in S. altissima than in S. gigantea. Within-population variation among genotypes was significant for most characters in the case of S. altissima. Phenological rate (reciprocal of days to flowering) and size at maturity showed a significant negative correlation among populations but not among genotypes within populations, indicating that genetic trade-offs may occur at one but not another infraspecific level. We suggest that the pattern of among-population variation reflects rapid adaptive population differentiation after introduction of the species to Europe.

AB Patterns of resistance to willow leaf rust caused by Melampsora sp. were measured on Salix eriocephala, Salix sericea, and their interspecific hybrids in natural field populations in 1991-94 and on potted plants in common garden experiments in 1994 and 1995. Testing was carried out to establish if the resistance of hybrids was intermediate between pure parental species (additive), equal to one of the parents (dominant), lower than both parents (susceptible), higher than both parents (resistant), or nor different than either parent (null hypothesis). Support was generally found for hybrid susceptibility in the field and common garden experiments, with the null hypothesis of no difference having some support. The results from the common garden study suggest that the susceptibility of hybrids seen in the field is due to genetic differences. Hybridization between these species of willows results in increased susceptibility to this pathogen. The variation among years in the relative susceptibility of hybrid and parental willows may be due to environmental effects on the willows or to shifts in the abundance of Melampsora races.

AB The sibling ground crickets Allonemobius fasciatus and A. socius meet along a mosaic hybrid zone at approximate to 40 degrees N latitude in eastern North America. In this paper we report the findings of a genetic analysis of calling-song variation within and among six cricket populations sampled along a transect through the hybrid zone in southern New Jersey. We compared aspects of the calling song of both wild-caught and laboratory-reared crickets to test the hypothesis that population differences in song observed in the wild were genetically based. We found significant, species-level differences in all aspects of the calling song, and these differences persisted even after a generation of common-garden rearing in the laboratory, supporting the hypothesis that interspecific variation observed in the wild largely reflects genetic differentiation between the two taxa. A discriminant function analysis indicated that individual crickets could be assigned to the proper taxon with less than 10% error, supporting the premise that calling song could be used by female crickets as a mechanism for species recognition. One population, collected from within the hybrid zone and containing significant numbers of hybrid individuals, was intermediate in its calling song, presumably reflecting this population's mixed genetic makeup. In this hybrid zone population, song phenotype was highly correlated to a hybrid index score generated using species-specific alleles at four diagnostic allozyme markers, suggesting a multigenic basis to calling-song variation in these crickets as well as linkage disequilibrium between markers and song. Based on an analysis of laboratory-reared full-sib families, broad-sense heritabilities for calling-song characteristics were generally significant in the two A. socius populations, whereas many components of song showed no significant family effects in the three A. fasciatus populations. The genotypically mixed, hybrid zone population showed very high heritabilities for most calling-song components, which likely reflect the influence of interspecific gene flow on genetic variation for quantitative traits.

AB 1. There are conflicting reports concerning the adaptive features of tree populations originating from cold, high-altitude environments. We hypothesize that such trees will possess adaptive features that will be demonstrated in a common environment, such as elevated rates of net CO2 exchange, elevated needle nitrogen concentration and high proportional biomass allocation to roots. To test this hypothesis we measured tree and seed properties of 54 populations of Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst.] located along eight altitudinal transects (from c. 600 to 1500 m) in southern Poland. We also measured growth, biomass partitioning, net photosynthetic capacity (A(max)), needle dark respiration (RS) and carbohydrate, nitrogen (N) and chlorophyll concentration of seedlings originating from these populations grown for 2 to 7 years in a common garden at 150 m elevation. Measured in situ along the elevational transects, there were linear declines in seed mass, average d.b.h. and height growth increment of seed trees with increased altitude or lower mean annual temperature.
   2, In the common garden, the Norway spruce populations from colder, high-altitude habitats had higher N concentration in needles than those from low altitudes. Both A(max) and needle RS increased with altitude of seed origin and were significantly related to needle N concentration. High-altitude populations also had higher concentrations of chlorophyll and carotene than those from low elevations. Despite higher photosynthetic rates in high-altitude populations, seedling height and dry mass in the common garden declined with altitude of seed origin. Proportional dry mass partitioning to roots nearly doubled with increasing altitude of origin, while the length of the shoot-growth period was reduced. The high respiration rates, high allocation to roots and reduced shoot-growth period are probably responsible for the low growth rate potential of high-altitude populations, more than offsetting their higher photosynthetic rates.
   3, The results of this study showed that Norway spruce populations from cold mountain environments are characterized by several potentially adaptive features. Because these were similar to conifer population responses along a latitudinal gradient of origin, they are probably driven by climate. These climate-driven differences were common to all transects: for a given altitude or mean annual temperature, plant traits were independent of mountain range of origin. However, populations originating from cold high-elevation sites often differed per unit change in altitude or mean annual temperature more than did low elevation populations. The scaling of nitrogen, CO2 exchange and biomass and allocation patterns may be useful in modelling Norway spruce response on montane forest ecosystems under changing environments.

AB Plant-soil feedbacks can alter N cycling rates in terrestrial ecosystems, but the mechanistic relationship between species characteristics, soil properties, and N dynamics is unclear. Plant species may affect patterns of soil aggregation, which can affect soil C and net N mineralization. This mechanism was examined in two common garden experiments: one containing five tree species (European larch [Larix decidua Miller], red oak [Quercus rubra L.], red pine [Pinus resinosa Ait.], white pine [Pinus strobus L,], and Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst]) and one containing six grass species (big bluestem [Andropogon gerardi Vitm.], indiangrass [Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash], prairie sandreed [Calamovilfa longifolia (Hook) Scrib,], switchgrass [Panicum virgatum L.], little bluestem [Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash.], and sideoats grama [Bouteloua curtipendula (Michx.) Torr.]), The grass monocultures are burned annually. Soils were wet sieved into four size classes (>2000, 250-2000, 53-250, and <53 mu m). Unsieved soil was incubated aerobically for 30 and 387 d to examine C and net N mineralization. For tree species, aggregate weighted mean diameter (WMD) differed between species (P = 0.01), and correlated positively with fungal biomass (r = 0.56). Large macro-aggregate (>2000 pm) C concentration ranged from 15 to 26 g kg(-1), and was lowest for Norway spruce and red oak (P = 0.07). Aggregate WMD correlated weakly (and negatively) with potentially mineralizable N (r = -0.57) and in situ net N mineralization (r = -0.67), but positively (again weakly) with potentially mineralizable C (r = 0.49). Grass species had no effect on aggregate-size distribution or organic matter concentration in spite of twofold differences in root biomass and threefold differences in N cycling rates. Species-induced changes in soil aggregation explained little of the variation in whole-soil C and N cycling rates, and are therefore unlikely to be an important mechanism explaining species effects on ecosystem processes.

SO SYSTEMATIC BOTANY

DT Article
ID SPECIES CONCEPT
AB Intraspecific morphological variation was investigated in the perennial sub-shrub Eriastrum densifolium to assess whether the five currently recognized subspecies adequately reflect the pattern and range of variation expressed in the species, and to determine if the endangered E, densifolium subsp. sanctorum is morphologically distinct from other populations. Vegetative and floral variation were analyzed at the species and population level, employing herbarium specimens, field collections, and common garden plants. The results of the analyses indicate that morphological variation within the species is largely continuous. The only exception is a group of plants distinguished from the remainder of the species by a single character, corolla cube length. This group of individuals matches the circumscription of E. densifolium subsp, sanctorum. The other four recognized subspecies fail to form well defined morphological groups in all analyses. Patterns of morphological variation are not correlated with either genetic variation of geography The overall pattern supports the recognition of only two subspecies in E. densifolium. One group represents a single morphologically divergent population (E. densifolium subsp. sanctorum), and the other group the remainder of the species, containing multiple, less divergent populations.

AB We investigated the distribution of genetic variation and the relationship between population size and genetic variation in the rare plant Gentianella germanica using RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) profiles. Plants for the analysis were grown from seeds sampled from 72 parent plants in II G. germanica populations of different size (40-5000 fruiting individuals). In large populations, seeds were sampled from parents in two spatially distinct subpopulations comparable in area to the total area covered by small populations. Analysis of molecular variance revealed significant genetic variation among populations (P < 0.001), while genetic variation among subpopulations was marginally significant (P < 0.06). Average molecular variance within subpopulations in large populations did not differ significantly from whole-population values. There was a positive correlation between genetic variation and population size (P < 0.01). Genetic variation was also positively correlated with the number of seeds per plant in the field (P < 0.02) and the number of flowers per planted seed in a common garden experiment (P < 0.051). We conclude that gene Row among natural populations is very limited and that reduced plant fitness in small populations of G. germanica most likely has genetic causes. Management should aim to increase the size of small populations to minimize further loss of genetic variation. Because a large proportion of genetic variation is among populations, even small populations are worth preserving.

   Implications for restoration efforts
SO RESTORATION ECOLOGY

DT Article

AB Aristida beyrichiana (wiregrass) is increasingly being planted in restoration projects across the southeastern coastal plain, with little focus on genetic differences among populations across the region. Local and regional population differentiation for establishment and growth traits were examined in common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments. Seeds from up to 20 plants from each of seven populations were collected in northern and central Florida sites that encompassed gradients of soils, hydrology, and temperature. Reciprocal seed transplants using three of the common garden populations were conducted in two consecutive years. In the common garden, significant population differences were seen in seed weight, seedling emergence and survival, tiller height, number of tillers, the relationship between tiller number and tiller height, and flowering. Variation among maternal families was seen in tiller number and in the relationship between tiller number and tiller height. The reciprocal transplant study did not detect either local adaptation to sites of origin or consistent superiority of one source population or planting site in seedling establishment. These results suggest that the probability of seedling establishment is primarily dependent on environmental conditions rather than genetic differences. Genetic variation for traits related to fitness (e.g., tiller number) may be retained within populations because phenotypically plastic growth responses of seedlings to environmental variation buffer genetic variation against the action of selection. But despite the lack of evidence for genetic influences on initial establishment in wiregrass, our common garden study suggests genetic differences among populations. This result, when combined with previous results indicating local adaptation in later life stages of wiregrass, suggests that restoration efforts involving this species should use local seed sources from sites with similar soil and hydrological conditions.

AB As part of a revegetation project, 16 accessions representing five varieties of Atriplex canescens (Pursch.) Nutt. were grown in a common garden experiment in northwestern New Mexico. The accessions were collected from Sonora, Mexico, to Idaho and from near sea level to 2800-m elevation. Plants were grown for 16 months on native soil irrigated with saline water (4800-9400 mg L(-1)) collected from a seepage intercept system surrounding the ash disposal ponds at a coal-fired power plant, at 1660-m elevation. All but var. grandidentatum from Mexico had high survival, but there was a fourfold variation in the amount of net growth among accessions. The northern accessions held 50% greater net growth than the southern accessions. Revegetation projects that utilize A. canescens need to match the seed source to the local site conditions. Saline water recovered from the leach fraction below power plant ash ponds can he used to establish stands of A. canescens for revegetation projects.

AB 1 We studied the relationships between population size, reproduction and population growth rate in 23 populations of the rare, short-lived plant Gentianella germanica. We also investigated a possible correlation of population size effects with environmental variation in climate, topography, soil, vegetation, and management. To ascertain whether the differences between populations have a genetic basis, we grew 20 seed families from each of the populations in a common garden experiment.
   2 In 1993, population sizes ranged from 40 to 5000 flowering plants in the field populations (geometric mean 386). Plants in small populations had fewer seeds per fruit and fewer seeds per plant than plants in larger populations, whereas seed mass was independent of population size. From 1993 to 1995 population size decreased in most populations (mean annual population growth rate 0.876), and this decrease was larger in small populations than in large populations.
   3 In the common garden the positive correlation between the number of surviving plants per planted seed and original population size increased steadily over time. After 17 months there were significantly more flowering plants and more flowers per planted seed for seeds from large populations than for those from small populations.
   4 Although environmental variables accounted for significant variation in population growth rate and plant performance both in the field and in the common garden, effects of population size detected in stepwise multiple regressions were not confounded with environmental effects.
   5 We conclude that the reduced performance observed in plants from smaller populations was explained by genetic effects rather than by habitat quality, although pollinator limitation may have contributed to fitness reductions in the held. The observed patterns suggest further reductions of population sizes in Gentianella germanica in the future, especially in already small populations. Our study lends support to the view that genetic problems are a major concern in plant conservation.

AB The expansion of Alliaria petiolata into a broad range of habitats in New Jersey was examined by comparing demographic and reproductive characteristics in four habitats that differed in availability of moisture and light. Plants behaved as strict biennials in all sites in all years. Survivorship, seed weight, and seed germination were lower in the drier habitats. The timing of flowering was later (1-2 weeks) in the drier habitats, although it did not appear to affect fruit maturation (as estimated by fruit abortion) which occurred during the drier months in all sites. Fecundity as measured by seeds/fruit and fruit production significantly differed among the populations although seeds/plant did not differ. Fruit abortion, which differed among the populations and among years, may be most influenced by environmental fluctuations rather than any characteristics intrinsic to the sites. The allocation of resources (biomass) to reproduction was greatest in the most disturbed site. A common garden experiment using seedlings from the two most contrasting sites suggested that variation in most traits (flowering phenology and resource allocation) was primarily a response to the environment. However, survivorship was more affected by seedling origin. This research suggests that A. petiolata responds to the broad range of habitats primarily by phenotypic plasticity. While A. petiolata had lower survivorship in the drier habitats; its phenotypic variation in demographic and reproductive characteristics may have allowed successful range expansion.

AB Work from the 1970s indicated that, relative to either parent species, crosses between red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) and black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) were inferior with respect to both growth and photosynthesis. We re-examined the hypothesis that there is negative heterosis in hybrids of red and black spruce using 22-year-old trees in a common garden study planted on two sites. The trees were the product of controlled crossings and represent a continuum from hybrid class 0 (pure black spruce) to hybrid class 1 (pure red spruce). Progeny of all controlled crosses were measured for height and diameter. A subset of families were measured for gas exchange and were assessed using a hybrid index based on needle color, needle configuration, twig ridges, twig bark color, vegetative bud color, and cone scale morphology. Tree,growth rate linearly declined with the increasing proportion of red spruce germplasm (increasing hybrid index). In 1994, intermediate hybrid index classes did not differ in gas exchange from either pure black spruce (hybrid index class 0) or pure red spruce (hybrid index class 1), and in 1996, hybrids displayed slightly higher rates of gas exchange. Thus, negative heterosis was not apparent in 22-year-old trees. Individual tree hybrid index generally agreed with expectation based on midparent means, although the relationship was stronger on the higher productivity site (r(2) = 0.91) than the poorer productivity site (r(2) = 0.54).

AB Plant fecundity is typically correlated with size (e.g. biomass); however, in plants whose reproduction is meristem-limited, there should be a stronger relationship between fecundity and architecture (the number and arrangement of subunits, or modules, composing a plant). In a reciprocal common garden experiment, I measured the effects of latitude-dependent flowering date on fecundity, biomass, and architecture in a photoperiodic annual (Perilla frutescens) to test the hypothesis that branch number limits flower production. If it does, the relationship between architecture and fecundity should remain constant across environments, even if the size-fecundity relationship varies. I planted Perilla seedlings from populations at 39 degrees 15'N and 33 degrees 05'N into a common garden at each latitude. Plants within a garden flowered on the same day, two weeks earlier in the south than in the north. Within a garden, size and flower number were positively correlated, but the slope of the relationship differed between gardens: plants of a given size made more flowers in the south than in the north. By contrast, the relationship between architecture and flower number was constant both within and between gardens. These data suggest that in meristem;limited plants, architecture is better than biomass at predicting fecundity across environments. Considering architecture, in addition to plant size, should enhance our understanding of environmental effects on plants whose reproduction is potentially meristem-limited.

AB Of particular value in understanding the evolution of genotypes with broad phenotypic ranges (phenotypic plasticity) are the few examples of organisms with adaptive plasticity, such as those that develop a defensive morphology in response to cues from predators. We know little about the heritability of inducible defensive characters or the range of phenotypes available for selection to act on in the field. Membranipora membranacea is a colonial marine bryozoan that produces spines within two days of exposure to waterborne predator extracts. Surveys done in 1993 and 1995 showed that the population at Friday Harbor Labs, Washington, was polymorphic for inducible spine type and was composed of a constitutively spined type that produced spines in the absence of a predator stimulus, an unspined phenotype that did not produce spines irrespective of a stimulus, and an inducibly spined phenotype that would produce spines if exposed to the appropriate cue. In 1995, the frequencies of these types were determined through a laboratory common-garden experiment; 178 colonies were cultured from metamorphosis through approximately 30 days and then exposed to the cue. The inducible type was the dominant, comprising 80.3% of the population. The constitutive type made up 6.2% of the population, and the remaining 13.4% was the unspined type. The frequency of the three types was similar to a preliminary trial of the experiment run in 1993. Experiments also showed that the lengths of the spines of the inducible type varied continuously among genotypes. To assess causes of variation in the inducible spine response and its clonal heritability, 16 clones were subdivided and grown in a common environment and exposed to a single dosage of spine inducing substance (SIS). Spine length showed high clonal heritability. The range of colony responses from a single environment varied from relatively unresponsive to highly responsive colonies with a very low threshold of response. Norms of reaction were quantified for spine lengths of inducible genotypes originating from two field environments by testing them in a concentration series of SIS. Both spine length and spine type varied with concentration of inducer. Within a clone, colonies were more likely to produce membranous spines than corner spines at higher concentrations. At low concentrations, only straight spines were produced. This study showed that populations of M. membranacea at Friday Harbor are a mix of inducible, nonspined and constitutively spined individuals. Even the inducible individuals showed high heritable variation in the length of spine activated, suggesting that there is considerable scope for the evolution of this character. A norm-of-reaction experiment further showed that the type of spine produced, membranous or corner, varied with the concentration of the cue. Factors maintaining the polymorphism and the broad range of genotypes could include high costs of defending the spined types coupled with a shifting biotic regime.

AB The major cultivated potato, Solanum tuberosum, and six other related cultivated species, are hypothesized to have arisen from a group of weedy relatives indigenous to the central Andes of central Peru, Bolivia, and northern Argentina. A major problem hindering investigations of the origins of the cultivated species has been a continuing debate over the species boundaries of their putative progenitors. This study investigated the morphological phenetic species boundaries of these putative progenitors and five cultivated taxa, here collectively referred to as the Solanum brevicaule complex. Two hundred fifteen accessions of 30 taxa in the S. brevicaule complex and 42 accessions of six taxa outside of the complex were assessed for 53 morphological traits in replicate plots ina common garden, resulting in a total of over 81000 data points. Phenetic analyses of these data are unable to support 30 taxa, suggesting instead a single variable complex at best only weakly divided into three widely intergrading sets of populations: (1) Peruvian and geographically adjacent Bolivian accessions (including wild species and all the cultigens), (2) Bolivian and Argentinian accessions and S. verrucosum from Mexico (including only wild species), and (3) the Bolivian and Argentinian wild species S. oplocense. These and other data suggest that Hawkes's 1990 treatment (The Potato: Evolution, Biodiversity, and Genetic Resources, Smithsonian Institute Press, Washington, DC.) of 232 morphological species is an overestimate for sect. Petota.

AB This study examined whether variation in reproductive allocation with size could be explained by differences in the trade-off between reproduction and growth. Seeds from 32 half-sibling families were collected from sites differing in mowing frequency and availability of light, nutrients, and water. Six seedlings from each family were grown in controlled environments and photoperiod manipulations were used to control reproduction. Mass of vegetative and reproductive plants of the same family were compared to assess the trade-off between reproduction and growth. Families collected from habitats with a tall canopy were larger and experienced a greater decrease in growth with reproduction than families from habitats where mowing maintained a short canopy. Reproductive output showed no relationship with size, while reproductive allocation (capsule mass to vegetative mass) decreased with size. This decrease may be a direct consequence of the increase in reproductive cost with size. The increase in cost can be partially explained by increased allocation to reproductive support structures; large individuals produce capsules on more elongate scapes and have a lower capsule to scape ratio. Differences in size and morphology among habitats are presumably the result of selection to avoid damage in mown sites and to avoid shade and ensure pollination in sites with a tall canopy and reduced wind movement.

AB Plantago major is a variable species that occupies a wide range of open habitats with a herbaueous canopy. Previous studies have shown that individuals from habitats where the canopy is kept short by mowing have a higher reproductive allocation than individuals from habitats with a tall canopy. The present study was conducted to determine whether or not the cost of reproduction differed between these two habitats. Fifteen half-sibling families, selected from a ranee of habitats differing in canopy bright were grown in the laboratory. Reproduction was controlled experimentally by photoperiod manipulations, and vegetative and reproductive plants of each family were transplanted to either a mown (short canopy) or unmown (tall canopy) grass sward in the fall of the first year. Number of leaves, length and width of largest leaf, and capsule production were monitored over the next 18 months. Total shoot biomass was determined at the end of this period. Cost of reproduction was assessed in threeways, by i) comparing the subsequent performance of vegetative and reproductive individuals, ii) calculating the phenotypic correlation between reproductive output in the first year of growth and subsequent performance using only those individuals that reproduced in the first year, and iii) calculating the above correlations at the among family level. Regardless of method used, cost of reproduction was smaller in the mown than in the unmown plots, suggesting that differences in cost among habitats may be involved in selecting for different allocation patterns.

AB This research was conducted to assess variation in the phytochemistry of aspen (Populus tremuloides Michaux) clones and its impact on two summer-feeding insect species: Canadian tiger swallowtails (Papilio canadensis Rothschild & Jordan) and big poplar sphinx moths (Pachysphinx modesta Harris). Eight aspen clones were established from root cuttings collected in the field and grown for two years in a common garden. Leaf tissues were assayed for water, nitrogen, total nonstructural carbohydrates, condensed tannins, and phenolic glycosides. Both long- and shea-term feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the effects of foliage quality on insect performance. Chemical analyses showed that concentrations of phytochemicals varied significantly among aspen clones, and that such variation was greater for secondary metabolites than for primary metabolites. Performance of both insect species varied among aspen clones and was negatively correlated with foliar phenolic glycoside concentrations. Comparison of results from this and an earlier study with the same plants indicates that genetic factors influence both clonal variation in secondary chemistry and phenological expression of such variation through time.

AB Previous heavy grazing for more than 50 years, compared with protection from livestock grazing, in the semi-arid area of Chaco Canyon in the southwestern United States did not result in any significant decrease in seed production potential of Indian ricegrass [Oryzopsis hymenoides (Roem, and Schult) Ricker], There also were no significant differences in seed production between grazed and ungrazed collections of Indian ricegrass from the Chaco Canyon study site when transplanted and grown in a common garden, This indicated that long-term protection from livestock grazing probably had not genetically (ecotypically) altered seed production potential, Both grazed and ungrazed transplants of Indian ricegrass differed in seed production from the cultivars 'Paloma' and 'Nezpar', Nezpar produced the greatest seed yield (312 kg/ha), while Paloma had the lowest yield (78 kg/ha), Defoliation about 1 June over a 2-year period reduced seed production and nitrogen fertilization did not increase seed yield.
   Previous grazing history had little effect on seed germination, but there were significant differences in germination among some collections and cultivars of Indian ricegrass, Germination was less than 5% for all entries, A tetrazolium viability test showed that seed of native strains were more viable than those of Paloma, Dormancy is a troublesome, but desirable, trait of Indian ricegrass seed for use in droughty areas.

AB Experiments investigating plant-herbivore interactions have primarily focused on above-ground herbivory, with occasional studies evaluating the effect of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This study investigated the growth of the wetland perennial Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) under three levels of root herbivory by the weevil Hylobius transversovittatus and three levels of plant competition by the grass Phleum pratense in a common garden. Plant growth, flowering phenology, and biomass allocation patterns of purple loosestrife were recorded for two growing seasons. During the first year, root herbivory reduced plant height; plant competition delayed flowering; and the interaction of root herbivory and plant competition resulted in reductions in plant height, shoot weight and total dry biomass. Plant competition or larval feeding did not affect the biomass allocation pattern in the first year. These results indicate the importance of interactions of plant competition and herbivory in reducing plant performance - at least during the establishment period of purple loosestrife. In the second growing season, root herbivory reduced plant height, biomass of all plant parts, delayed and shortened the flowering period, and changed the biomass allocation patterns. Plant competition delayed flowering and reduced the dry weight of fine roots. The interaction of root herbivory and plant competition delayed flowering. Root herbivory was more important than plant competition in reducing the performance of established purple loosestrife plants. This was due, in part, to intense intraspecific competition among the grass individuals effectively preventing shoot elongation of P. pratense and resulting in a carpet like growth.

AB Metrosideros polymorpha, a dominant tree species in Hawaiian ecosystems, occupies a wide range of habitats. Complementary field and common-garden studies of M. polymorpha populations were conducted across an altitudinal gradient at two different substrate ages to ascertain if the large phenotypic variation of this species is determined by genetic differences or by phenotypic modifications resulting from environmental conditions. Several characteristics, including ecophysiological behavior and anatomical features, were largely induced by the environment. However, other characteristics, particularly leaf morphology, appeared to be mainly determined by genetic background. Common garden plants exhibited higher average rates of net assimilation (5.8 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and higher average stomatal conductance (0.18 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1)) than their field counterparts (3.0 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1), and 0.13 mol H2O m(-2) s(-1) respectively). Foliar delta(13)C of most common-garden plants was similar among sites of origin with an average value of -26.9 parts per thousand. In contrast, mean values of foliar delta(13)C in field plants increased substantially from -29.5 parts per thousand at low elevation to -24.8 parts per thousand at high elevation. Leaf mass per unit area increased significantly as a function of elevation in both field and common garden plants; however, the range of values was much narrower in common garden plants (211-308 g m(-2) for common garden versus 107-407 g m(-2) for field plants). Nitrogen content measured on a leaf area basis in common garden plants ranged from 1.4 g m(-2) to 2.4 g m(-2) and from 0.8 g m(-2) to 2.5 g m(-2) in field plants. Photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) decreased 50% with increasing elevation in field plants and only 20% in plants from young substrates in the common garden. This was a result of higher rates of net CO2 assimilation in the common garden plants. Leaf tissue and cell layer thickness, and degree of leaf pubescence increased significantly with elevation in field plants, whereas in common garden plants, variation with elevation of origin was much narrower, or was entirely absent. Morphological characteristics such as leaf size, petiole length, and internode length decreased with increasing elevation in the field and were retained when grown in the common garden, suggesting a potential genetic basis for these traits. The combination of environmentally induced variability in physiological and anatomical characteristics and genetically determined variation in morphological traits allows Hawaiian M. polymorpha to attain and dominate an extremely wide ecological distribution not observed in other tree species.

AB Levels and distribution of genetic variation were investigated in ten populations of the perennial Arabis serrata distributed along a latitudinal gradient throughout Japan. Populations of this endemic species occupy predominantly three types of habitats: limestone and derived soils, volcanic and disturbed sites. Previous studies showed that plants of A. serrata are differentiated in morphological and ecological traits under both natural conditions and common garden experiments suggesting genetic differentiation among populations. To assess the degree of genetic differentiation under different habitats of A. serrata populations, we analyzed the isozyme genetic structure. Ten populations, located in mountains of central and northern Honshu and Hokkaido, were analyzed by starch gel enzyme electrophoresis. Fourteen loci of eight enzymes were resolved and six loci were monomorphic for all the populations. Populations sampled maintain low levels of genetic variation (P=0.16; H=0.05, A=1.16) compared to that maintained by other outcrossing seed plants. In some cases, few or no heterozygous individuals were detected, and consequently, mean observed heterozygosity was zero or near zero. Six (29%) of the fixation indices, F, estimated deviated significantly from Hardy Weinberg genotypic expectations indicating a deficiency of heterozygotes in most of the cases. The mean genetic identity (Nei's I) between population pairs was 0.852 and indicates a moderate level of genetic differentiation among populations. Arabis serrata has most of its genetic variation distributed among rather than within populations. The among-population component of the total genetic diversity (G(ST) mean value) was 0.416, indicating genetic differentiation between populations. There groups of populations were recognized in an unrooted tree generated by the Neighbor-Joining method. These results suggest groups of populations differentiated regionally. Estimates of interpopulational gene flow (Nm) were very variable (range 0.049-3.718) with a mean Nm=1.203 for all populations.

AB Field studies were conducted in Colorado and New Mexico to examine growth and development of spurred anoda accessions from Colorado, Mississippi, New Mexico, and North Carolina. Accessions were grown in a common garden in both locations. Leaf and stem weight ratios, leaf area ratio, and leaf area per plant were determined. North Carolina and Mississippi accessions were similar in morphology and appearance. Leaf shape, degree of pubescence, and coloration were different in the Colorado and New Mexico accessions. At both sites, the Colorado accession was taller and the canopy wider than other accessions. In Colorado in 1993, North Carolina and New Mexico accessions had the highest total weight followed by Colorado, then Mississippi. In 1994, final total weights of North Carolina, Mississippi, and New Mexico accessions were similar and greater than the Colorado accession. AU accessions had similar final total weights in New Mexico in 1993. In 1994, Mississippi, North Carolina, and New Mexico accessions had similar total weights. The Colorado accession flowered earlier than other accessions. Seeds from Mississippi and North Carolina accessions grown in Colorado were heavier than the New Mexico or Colorado accession. This research demonstrates why making inferences of weed biology for variable species that occur over diverse geographic and climatic conditions is difficult and why regionally specific data are needed for variable species.

AB We examined the relationship between pond duration and life history characters of the clam shrimp Eulimnadia texana, a species inhabiting ephemeral ponds in southwestern North America. Since the shrimp live in temporary habitats, we predicted that there should be high selection pressure on life history characteristics associated with rapid development (e.g., fast growth, early maturity, etc.), rather than selection for increased longevity. Pond duration was estimated using a combination of average monthly rainfall and pond size (surface to volume ratio). Shrimp that live in smaller ponds thigh surface to volume ratio) in areas with low average rainfall should, on average, experience a shorter total time available for development than those in larger ponds or in areas of higher rainfall. These shrimp should have an earlier age at maturity, reduced longevity, lower fecundity, and faster growth. Five replicate populations of clam shrimp were collected as cysts from five ponds. These shrimp were raised in a common garden experiment in the laboratory. Daily measurements of growth and egg production were taken and ages at maturity and death were recorded. Shrimp from areas with higher average rainfall had slower growth, higher fecundity, greater longevity, and an earlier age at maturity than those from areas with lower average rainfall. If average rainfall is an accurate measure of pond duration, then the first three of these life history traits differ in the directions expected. However, age at maturity varied in a manner opposite to that expected, being earlier in the ponds with longer duration. Surface to volume ratio was not helpful in further resolving differences in these life history characters.

AB Tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) vary in throat fan (dewlap) color. Earlier, we described five dewlap types (Orange, Orange-Blue, Yellow, Yellow-Blue, and Blue), and reported that only males had blue in the dewlap and that presence or absence of a discrete blue patch was correlated with male alternative reproductive phenotypes in a central Arizona population. Here, with a modified scheme characterizing two dewlap elements, background color (orange, yellow, blue) and blue patch occurrence, we assessed: (1) sexual, annual, and geographic variation in the frequencies of dewlap elements; (2) simple habitat correlates; and (3) the effects of laboratory rearing regime on dewlap type. Within a population, frequencies of males and females expressing orange or yellow backgrounds did not differ, suggesting that control of background is similar in the sexes. Within several populations, frequencies of the dewlap elements did not differ across years (and probably generations), indicating that phenotype frequencies are relatively stable. Among five populations frequencies of background colors varied, as did frequencies of male types (blue patch present or absent). Dewlap frequencies did not correlate with habitat (boulders or mesquite trees), although few populations were sampled. In male and female offspring reared from eggs to sexual maturity in a common-garden laboratory study, background color frequencies in both sexes and blue patch frequencies in males differed among offspring from different populations. Offspring frequencies matched respective parental population frequencies. Results suggest that among-population variation in frequencies of the two dewlap elements are mediated by differences in genetics, in maternal effects, or both. Thus, differences in male behavior functionally linked to the blue patch also may be controlled by genetic or maternal effects.

AB Quantitative genetics has been an immensely powerful tool in manipulating the phenotypes of domesticated plants and animals. Much of the predictive power of quantitative genetics depends on the breeder's control over the context in which phenotype and mating are being expressed. In the natural world, these contexts are often difficult to describe, let alone control. We are left, therefore, with a poor understanding of the limits of quantitative genetics in natural populations. One of the crucial contextual elements for assessing breeding value is the genetic background in which an individual's genes are being assessed. When interacting genes are polymorphic within a population, the degree of mating among relatives can influence the correlations among mates and the predictions of a response to selection. Population structure can strongly influence the degree to which dominance and epistasis influences additive genetic variance and heritability. The extent of inbreeding can also influence heritabilities through its effect on the environmental component of phenotypic variance. The applicability of standard quantitative genetic breeding designs to the measurement of heritabilities in natural populations therefore depends in part on: (1) the mating system of the population; and (2) the importance of gene interactions in determining phenotypic variation. We tested for an effect of mating structure on the partitioning of phenotypic variance and heritability by comparing two breeding designs in a common environment. Both breeding designs used 139 pollen parents taken from mapped locations in a population of Plantago lanceolata L., and crossed to 280 seed parents from the same population. One design was random-mating, the second was biased toward near-neighbor matings to an extent determined by held measure of pollen-mediated gene flow distances. The offspring were grown randomly mixed in a common garden. Nine traits were measured: central corm diameter, number of leaves, area of the most recently fully expanded leaf, density of hairs (cm(-2)) on the leaves, dry weight per unit leaf area. photosynthetic capacity, transpiration rates, water use efficiency, and reproductive dry weight. Heritabilities and variance components from the two designs were compared using randomization tests. None of the variance components or the heritabilities differed significantly between breeding designs at the 0.05 level. The test could distinguish differences between the heritabilities measured in the two breeding designs as small as 0.11, on average. Thus, for the degree of inbreeding normally exhibited in P. lanceolata there is insufficient gene interaction present within populations to influence the partitioning of variance between additive and nonadditive components or to influence heritability estimates to a meaningful extent. We suggest that for Plantago other sources of variation in heritability estimates, such as maternal effects and genotype x environment interactions, are more important influences than the interaction between inbreeding and gene interactions, and standard heritability estimate based on random breeding is as accurate as one taking the natural mating structure into account.

AB Seven-year-old Pinus sylvestris were studied in two field trials with respect to height growth and injury caused by the fungal pathogen Melampsora pinitorqua. Each trial comprised single-tree progenies from two to 11 parent trees from each of 45 pine populations in northern Sweden (open pollinated) and Finland (control pollinated with a pollen mixture from 22 north Swedish trees). Heritability estimates were in the range of 6-18%. Most of genetic variation in height growth and rust resistance in Swedish populations and in height growth in Finnish populations occurred within populations (86-100%). In populations of Finnish origin variation in rust resistance consisted of more equal among-and within-population components (68% and 32%, respectively). Family genetic correlations between pathogen resistance and tree height the previous year (disease-free environment) were positive among Finnish populations and Swedish coast populations, suggesting that pathogen resistance confers fitness benefits even in the absence of disease, whereas Swedish inland populations showed a negative correlation indicative of fitness costs. Patterns of genetic correlations at the population level tended to be just the reverse compared with those found at the family level. No genotype x trial interactions were detected for any of the examined characters. Prerequisites for establishment of a genecological balance between host and parasite are discussed.

AB Because amphicarpy is strongly associated with heterogeneous habitats, it can be difficult to document and interpret infraspecific differentiation in amphicarpic species. In the woodland annual Amphicarpaea bracteata, a canonical variates analysis (CVA) of morphological data from herbarium specimens provided initial support for the recognition of two distinct varieties. Subsequently, common garden and greenhouse studies were conducted with multiple populations of these two well-marked varieties, A. bracteata var. comosa and A. bracteata var, bracteata. Because the variety comosa is restricted to sunnier habitats while the variety bracteata spans a broad range of habitats, these studies included bracteata populations from both densely shaded and sunny habitats. CVA of the greenhouse data indicated that the varieties comosa and bracteata maintained discrete differences in leaf morphology. Thus, varietal differences are, in part, genetically based rather than solely plastic responses to the local environment. Differences between shade- and sun-native bracteata populations, although relatively minor, also appeared to be, in part, genetically based. Consistent with its affinity for sunnier habitats, the variety comosa achieved superior survivorship and fecundity under high light conditions. However, fecundity was greater in shade-native than in sun-native bracteata populations. In combination with trends in leaf morphology, these results support the idea that the variety comosa is a sun-adapted ecotype, but not the concept that shade- and sun-native bracteata populations are, respectively, shade- and sun-adapted.

AB Whether or not low frequency electromagnetic fields can affect living systems is an important biological question with public health implications. Smith et al. [1] reported that the growth of seedlings of Raphanus sativus L., the common garden radish, was enhanced when exposed for 21 days in a continuous 60 Hz electromagnetic field tuned to the 'ion cyclotron resonance' for calcium. They suggested that R. sativus could become a standard system for testing bioelectromagnetic effects. We measured up to 15 developmental parameters, including the chlorophyll content of the leaves. Unlike Smith et al. [1], we found no measurable effect of EMF on the development of R. sativus. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.

AB Genetic variation in spring cold hardiness of shoots prior to bud break was studied in two Oregon breeding populations of Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii (Mirb.) France, one on the west slope of the Cascade Mountains and the other in the Coast Range. In March and April 1993, and April 1994, shoot cuttings from 40 open-pollinated families in each of two progeny test sites in each breeding zone were subjected to artificial freezing. Visible cold damage to needle, stem, and bud tissues was recorded. Date of bud burst (all sites), and injury resulting from a 1992 natural frost event (one site), were also recorded. Spring cold injury varied widely among families. Individual heritabilities for spring cold injury scores averaged 0.76 in the Coastal zone and 0.42 in the Cascade zone. Genetic correlations among tissues, sites, sampling dates, and years, and between April cold injury and date of bud burst were high, in most cases over 0.80. Correlations were also strong between natural frost damage in 1992 and artificial cold injury scores in 1993. Artificial freeze testing stem tissues of cut shoots sampled in April from a single test site should effectively rank families in this region for spring cold hardiness.

AB The ability to identify genetic regulation of quantitative traits is often complicated by environmentally induced variation. The purpose of this study was to determine if the variance in biomass and physiological traits is larger for populations of genetically distinct individuals (genets) compared with populations of genetically identical individuals (ramets) of the same species. Spartium junceum L. was used for this study because it is a weedy species, and variation in quantitative traits is important for its invasive characteristic. Several mean growth traits were significantly different between ramet and genet populations. The variance in biomass traits was higher for genet populations in 26 of 30 comparisons with ramet populations. In contrast, few mean physiological traits differed between ramet and genet populations, and trait variance was equal between the two population types in 23 out of 30 comparisons. Thus, even under uniform growth conditions in a greenhouse, environmental variance accounts for a large proportion of population variance in physiological traits. Environmental variance also accounted for ca. 33% of phenotypic variance in biomass traits. The results of this study have important implications for common garden and reaction norm studies of genetic determination of quantitative physiological traits.

AB We investigated the scale of genetic variation of purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra), a species commonly used in California for grassland restoration. Common garden and field data revealed evidence of genetic differentiation between two intermixed microhabitats characterized by differences in soil depth and community composition. We assessed the genetic variation within a single population using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data collected from clusters of five individuals in 40 locations. We found no evidence for genetic structure at the whole population level. At smaller spatial scales, however, we found strong evidence that genetic subdivision of the population occurs at the level of the maternal neighborhood. We suggest that the interaction between widespread pollen dispersal and restricted seed dispersal may be the primary factor generating these results; panmictic pollen dispersal will make detection of genetic patterning difficult at larger spatial scales while limited seed dispersal will generate local genetic structure. As a result, the detection of population genetic structure will depend on the spatial scale of analysis. Local selection gradients related to topography and soil depth are also likely to play a role in structuring local genetic variation. Since N. pulchra is widely used in California in grassland and woodland habitat restoration, we suggest that, as a general rule, care should be exercised in transferring germplasm for the purposes of conservation when little is known about the within-population genetic subdivision of a plant species.

AB Glabrous and pubescent foliar phenotypes of Metrosideros polymorpha occur sympatrically on Mauna Loa, Hawaii. This coexistence has been suggested, by earlier workers, to represent distinct genotypes, each of which produces progenies with a homogenous foliar phenotype. We re-examined the question of to what extent siblings from the same parents varied in phenotype when grown under the same common-garden conditions. Seeds were collected from parental trees in a matrix of two substrate ages (114-140 yr vs. approx. 1200-3200 yr old) at five elevations from lowland (100 m) to treeline (2470 m) on Mauna Loa. Seeds were sown and grown under identical environmental conditions at 1200 m. In field parental populations, two forms converged into pubescent forms with decreasing rainfall (< 2000 mm) on both substrates, and into glabrous forms with increasing soil age where rainfall was ample. The 4-yr old seedlings from pubescent parents invariably expressed both glabrous and pubescent phenotypes for all altitudes and for both substrate ages except for the young 1980-m site. The seedlings from glabrous parents tended to express only the glabrous phenotypes except for the young 1280-m site. Overall, all populations on the young lava flow (glabrous and pubescent individuals combined if coexisting) could produce progenies of both phenotypes except al 1980 m. Cuticle thickness on the adaxial lamina surface was positively correlated with the magnitude of pubescence (P = 0.05) among siblings from the same parents, ranging from a mean cuticle thickness of 6.0 mu m for glabrous to 15.7 mu m for the most pubescent individuals. Greater magnitudes of pubescence were associated with more negative osmotic potentials at turgor loss point, and with greater maximum CO2 assimilation rates at the point of light saturation. This physiological and anatomical polymorphism, together with spatially and temporally varying selective forces, appears to result in elevationally and successionally patterned M. polymorpha populations on the wet slope of Mauna Loa.

AB Common garden experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis that the genetic capacity for growth of striped bass (Morone saxatilis) varies inversely with length of the growing season across a latitudinal gradient (i.e., countergradient variation (CnGV) in growth). Newly hatched larvae were obtained from six native anadromous stocks spanning most of the natural range of striped bass (Florida to Nova Scotia). Growth experiments were conducted under conditions of unlimited food at three temperatures (17, 21, 28 degrees C) and commenced after larvae had exhausted maternal energy resources (i.e., yolk and oil) and had begun to metamorphose. Mixed-model nested ANOVA demonstrated that length and dry weight growth differed significantly among latitudes in most comparisons. South Carolina fish ranked consistently as the slowest growing group in virtually all comparisons, but the rank order of the other latitudes differed among trials. North Carolina and Gulf of Mexico fish generally had intermediate rates of growth whereas New York, Maryland, and Nova Scotia fish generally had the highest growth. Overall, the average growth rate of progeny from the 28 mothers tested in this study had a strong positive correlation with latitude of origin, strongly indicating CnGV in growth.

AB Helenium virginicum is a narrow endemic seasonal wetland plant that is listed as a candidate for endangered or threatened status by the Federal government, and is listed as endangered by the state of Virginia. We investigated the breeding system of one population of this rare plant to gain insight into its limited distribution and abundance, and to guide development of management strategies. Experiments revealed that, like most members of the Asteraceae, H. virginicum is self-incompatible. In a common garden where water and nutrients were not limited, 28 plants from a single H. virginicum population each were both selfed and outcrossed from a large pooled sample of pollen. A mean seed set per head of 76.8% was found in outcrossed heads, compared to only 0.8% in selfed heads. Sporophytic self-incompatibility also was determined based on stigmatic pollen tube inhibition. A self-incompatible breeding system may put small populations of H. virginicum at risk of local extinction due to the limited availability of compatible mates, and should be considered when designing effective conservation and management strategies.

AB Intra-clutch offspring size variability is quantified and compared in nine European populations of the freshwater zooplankter Daphnia magna. Mean values for coefficients of variation for intra-clutch neonate body-length were low, and similar, within and between populations (range = 1.8 to 4.4%). There was little evidence that offspring size variability increased with increasing environmental uncertainty and, under 'common garden' laboratory conditions, maternal genotypes collected from more uncertain environments did not produce clutches with a greater range of offspring sizes. Maternal body-length and growth rate did not significantly correlate with offspring size variability. However, there was a marginally significant positive correlation between clutch size and offspring size variability when data across populations were pooled.

AB Cranberry flowers (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait,) require bee visitation for pollination. Bees visit cranberry flowers for nectar and sometimes pollen, but honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in particular often work alternative co-flowering species for nectar, presumably because cranberry offers inferior nectar rewards, In a common garden setting, replicated plots of the cultivar Stevens were found to secrete significantly more nectar sugar (25 % to 35 % more) per flower than either 'Ben Lear' or 'Early Black', two other common commercial cultivars. The nectar secretion rate of 'Stevens' was unaffected by a 4-fold range of fertilizer application rates over the preceding 2 years, These results are compared to studies of other crops involving varietal differences and programs of selective breeding for nectar secretion.

AB The occurrence of fungi was investigated in the gut of 200 common garden lizards (Agama agama). The most important pathogenic fungus isolated was Basidiobolus haptosporus, an aetiological agent of subcutaneous zygomycosis. It was recovered from the intestinal contents of 112 (56%) lizards. Other important fungi isolated included Aspergillus spp. in 24 (12%) lizards, Candida spp. in 12 (6%), Penicillium spp. in 12 (6%) and Fusarium spp. in 12 (6%). Mucor spp. were isolated from eight: (4%) male lizards only. Agamid lizards are plentiful in rural and urban areas of Nigeria. As they live in close vicinity to man, they are likely to play an important role in the spread of disease that may be caused by these fungi and its transmission to man. None of the animals investigated that yielded fungal cultures revealed any external fungal infection.

TI Interactions between herbivores and endophyte-infected Festuca rubra

AB 1, Fungal endophytes of tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea, have been found to synthesize toxic alkaloids which function as an anti-herbivore defence. Ingestion of infected F. arundinacea causes widespread losses to the US livestock industry. We investigated whether the fungal endophyte Acremonium in the congeneric species, Festuca rubra, may be playing a similar role on four Scottish islands.
   2, Hirta, an island in the St. Kilda group, is grazed by a population of feral Soay sheep which crashes every 3-5 years with up to 60% mortality. Fungal endophytes of F. rubla were present in 65-100% of shoots. Infection frequency was positively correlated with grazing pressure. Infection was significantly lower on the neighbouring ungrazed island of Dun, supporting the hypothesis that endophytes function to deter herbivory.
   3, In contrast, on the Hebridean islands of Rum and Benbecula, there were no significant differences in endophyte infection between grazed and ungrazed populations of F. rubra. Here, infection rates were lower than on Hirta, suggesting that endophyte-host-grazer interactions were not significant.
   4, In common garden experiments with F. rubra from St. Kilda and Rum, endophyte infection resulted in higher survival rates of plants. However, there were no significant differences between infected and uninfected plants in leaf and shoot growth. Thus, while variation in infection frequencies on Hirta was most likely due to selective grazing of uninfected plants, the effect of infection status on plant survival may also have influenced these frequencies.
   5, Infected F. rubra from St. Kilda was found to be toxic and cause mortality in locust bioassays. Two additional results suggested that the fungal endophytes of F. rubra may function as an antiherbivore defence which is inducible, and could influence sheep population crashes on St. Kilda. First, the concentration of endophytic hyphae was significantly greater in infected plants from grazed patches than infected plants from adjacent ungrazed patches, This indicated a relationship between grazing pressure and endophyte concentration. Secondly, in a simulated grazing experiment with infected plants from St. Kilda, levels of the ergot alkaloid, ergovaline, in clipped plants were significantly greater than the undetectable levels in infected plants which were not clipped ('ungrazed') for 12 months.

AB Using species-specific random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers and morphological characters, natural hybridization between the closely related black spruce Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P. and red spruce P. rubens Sarg. was evaluated in natural populations from north-eastern North America. Sampling included populations from both areas of allopatry and also 14 populations from part of the area of sympatry located in the province of Quebec and covering several thousands of square kilometres. Classification results from RAPD species-specific markers and from a discriminant function based on morphology were compared. Molecular analysis of the allopatric populations indicated a small amount of interspecific gene leakage with no asymmetric directionality to introgression. A high occurrence of hybrid/introgressant individuals was observed within sympatric populations, suggesting weak reproductive isolation. As expected, the detection of such individuals was more efficient using molecular markers than with morphological traits. The hybrid zone appeared extensive with variable species structure and, in some stands, the main component composed of hybrid/introgressant trees. Implications for the genecology and genetic management of these species are discussed.

AB Plant populations with different ploidy levels have frequently been found to develop mechanisms of reproductive isolation when they occur in contact, presumably because of selection against the production of inviable or sterile hybrids. A parapatric contact zone between diploid and tetraploid Arrhenatherum elatius has been identified in the Spanish Pyrenees. Of 145 flowering plants sampled in the zone one was triploid. This study provides data on enzymatic allele frequencies, flowering time and selfing rate across the contact zone, to examine whether reproductive isolation occurs to limit the potential production of triploids. To substantiate these data, flowering time was measured in plants grown in a common garden and outcrossing rates were compared to those in one allopatric population of each cytotype from an environmentally similar habitat. Nei's genetic distances calculated on the basis of allele frequencies showed no clear evidence for past hybridization and/or introgression between diploids and tetraploids. Patterns of flowering phenoloy in the field and in controlled conditions indicated almost total flowering divergence between parapatric cytotypes; this divergence may be under genetic control. There was, however, no evidence of current phenotypic selection on flowering date in the contact zone. For each cytotype, multilocus selfing rates were higher in parapatric populations than in allopatric populations. The possibility that flowering time divergence and increased selfing have evolved in the contact zone resulting in reproductive isolation is discussed.

AB Sanguinaria canadensis L. is a rhizomatous understory perennial herb that varies considerably in clone size, leaf size and allocation to sexual reproduction among local populations. Permanent plots were established in a high-light site with large, many-leafed plants and a low-light site with small, few-leafed plants. Within these plots, a reciprocal transplant study was performed to separate local evolutionary differentiation from environmentally determined differentiation. Also, half the plots in each site were fertilized to explore effects of soil fertility on vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Plants from a third high-light site were used in a potting study to explore combined influences of elevated sunlight and fertilization on vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. Fertilization resulted in plants with proportionally fewer small and more large leaves in high-light permanent plots and had no effect on plants growing in low-light permanent plots. Fertilization increased leaf number and total leaf area, but had no influence on seed production in the potting and reciprocal transplant studies. Unshaded plants had significantly more leaves and greater total leaf area in the potting study. Also, in the high-light site of the reciprocal transplant study, both fertilized and unfertilized plants (especially fertilized plants originating from the high-light site) had more leaves and a higher total leaf area per plant than plants growing in the low-light site. Light intensity did not influence seed production in the potting study; however, more seeds were produced on plants growing in the high-light site than in the low-light site. Mortality was high for plants transplanted into the low-light site and for fertilized plants growing in shade in the common garden study. Clonal growth as measured by leaf size and leaf number in S. canadensis is highly plastic and responds vigorously to increased sunlight and to fertilization when under high-light conditions. In contrast, sexual reproduction exhibits relatively little plasticity. We suggest that local populations of S. canadensis rapidly respond to increases in light and nutrients associated with disturbance through increased clonal growth. This rapid response to environmental variability may partly explain the patchy spatial distribution of S. canadensis populations.

AB Body size is often assumed to represent the outcome of conflicting selection pressures of natural and sexual selection. Marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) populations in the Galapagos exhibit 10-fold differences in body mass between island populations. There is also strong sexual size dimorphism, with males being about twice as heavy as females. To understand the evolutionary processes shaping body size in marine iguanas, we analyzed the selection differentials on body size in two island populations (max. male mass 900 g in Genovesa, 3500 g in Santa Fe). Factors that usually confound any evolutionary analysis of body sizes-predation, interspecific food competition, reproductive role division-are ruled out for marine iguanas. We show that, above hatchlings, mortality rates increased with body size in both sexes to the same extent. This effect was independent of individual age. The largest animals (males) of each island were the first to die once environmental conditions deteriorated (e.g., during El Ninos). This sex-biased mortality was the result of sexual size dimorphism, but at the same time caused sexual size dimorphism to fluctuate. Mortality differed between seasons (selection differentials as low as -1.4) and acted on different absolute body sizes between islands. Both males and females did not cease growth when an optimal body size for survival was reached, as demonstrated by the fact that individual adult body size phenotypically increased in each population under favorable environmental conditions beyond naturally selected limits. But why did marine iguanas grow ''too large'' for survival Due to lek mating, sexual selection constantly favored large body size in males (selection differentials up to +0.77). Females only need to reach a body size sufficient to produce surviving offspring. Thereafter, large body size of females was less favored by fertility selection than large size in males. Resulting from these different selection pressures on male and female size, sexual size dimorphism was mechanistically caused by the fact that females matured at an earlier age and size than males, whereafter they constantly allocated resources into eggs, which slowed growth. The observed allometric increase in sexual size dimorphism is explained by the fact that the difference between these selective processes becomes larger as energy abundance in the environment increases. Because body size is generally highly heritable, these selective processes are expected to lead to genetic differences in body size between islands. We propose a common-garden experiment to determine the influence of genetic factors and phenotypic reaction norms of final body size.

AB Festuca rubra, a clonal grass of mountain grasslands, possesses a considerable variability in traits related to spatial spreading (rhizome production, length and branching; tussock architecture). Since these traits highly influence the success of the species in a spatially heterogeneous system of grasslands, a combined field and growth chamber approach was adopted to determine the within-population variation in these parameters. Clones were sampled in a mountain grassland (The Krkonose Mts., Czech Republic); the environment (mean neighbour density) of individual clones varied highly. Before the clones were collected, shoot demography and tussock architecture within these clones were recorded in the field for four seasons. Their clone identity was determined using DNA RAPD. Vegetatively propagated plants from these clones were cultivated in a common garden experiment to demonstrate variation in tussock growth and architecture. Their response to change in red/far red light ratio was determined in the growth chamber.
   Highly significant variation among clones was found in almost all parameters. In the common garden, the clones differed in tussock growth (mean tillering rate), architecture (mean shoot angle, mean tussock density) and proportion of flowering shoots. In the growth chamber, both the aboveground parameters and parameters of the rhizome system were strongly affected by red/far red ratio; among-clone variation was also almost always significant. The genotype x environment interaction was significant for tillering rate and rhizome architecture. The structure of the rhizome system (which is the major component of clonal spread in space) is a complex result of several components whose inter-clone variations differ: (i) genetically determined mean rhizome system sizer (ii) overall plasticity in rhizome system size (with no significant genetic variation in plasticity), and (iii) genetically determined plasticity in rhizome architecture. Because of the variation in plasticity in rhizome architecture, some clones seemed to possess the ability to exploit a favourable habitat patch by producing short branches when there; whereas the remaining clones appeared to possess only a simple escape mechanism from unfavourable patches.
   Environmental variation in the light levels in the studied grassland is fine grained; horizontal growth rates of F. rubra are sufficient to make genets experience different patches in their lifetime. The high variation in both, genotype means and plasticities is likely to be due to selection early in genet life in an environment which is heterogeneous at a fine scale.

AB We tested the hypothesis that prior grazing history would influence the defoliation responses of Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis) growing in a common garden environment, Plants were taken from a grazed pasture and adjacent exclosure which had not been grazed since 1937, and established in a common garden at 1 m spacings during spring of 1989. Plants from defoliated and nondefoliated treatments within the 2 populations were sampled during 1992 and 1993. Photosynthesis, conductance to H2O, and xylem potentials were measured during the 2 growing seasons, and carbon isotope ratio (delta(13)C) was measured for senescent leaf tissue, Both within exclosure and outside exclosure defoliated plants exhibited compensatory photosynthesis that averaged a 12% increase the first year, and a 52% increase during the second year, compared with nondefoliated plants, No differences in photosynthesis occurred between the 2 collections, However, outside exclosure plants had higher stomatal conductance than did exclosure plants for the dry year 1992, Also, outside exclosure plants exhibited more negative delta(13)C (thus lower water use efficiency) than exclosure plants for 1992 and 1993. We suggest that the higher conductance of previously-grazed plants relative to nongrazed plant populations may be an adaptive response to greater soil moisture often found in grazed sites.

SO MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL

ID ALGAE; METALS
AB Hazardous waste sites are a major problem and of heightened concern for the world today. Many conventional and experimental technologies are available for soil remediation. Unfortunately, the costs associated with the majority of these methods are nearly equivalent to the benefits. Heavy metal contaminants are quite common and present increased difficulty in soil remediation. Currently, the method most frequently used for the remediation of sites contaminated with heavy metals is excavation. This process is both expensive and impractical. A method that offers significantly more benefits than conventional technology is the use of plants to accumulate heavy metals from the soil. It is less expensive and safer for humans and the environment. A group of native plants found in western Kentucky have been identified as potential phytoremediators, along with common garden plants, which have the ability to hyperaccumulate lead and/or aluminum. Lettuce, cantaloupe, and corn are capable of collecting significant amounts of aluminum. Cauliflower and tomato plants can accumulate both aluminum and lead. The hyperaccumulation of heavy metals by these plants could be used as one solution to a costly environmental cleanup problem. (C) 1997 Academic Press.

AB Species with contrasting abilities for dispersal may adopt different strategies in response to wide ranges of environmental conditions. These strategies were investigated here by comparisons of phenotypic differentiation and plasticity in the gastropods Austrocochlea constricta and Bembicium vittatum, which coexist in a range of intertidal habitats on the Abrolhos Islands and Albany in Western Australia. They differ in their potential for larval dispersal, A. constricta having a short mobile planktonic stage and B. vittatum developing directly from benthic eggs. Levels of among-population variation in shell shape and maximum size did not differ between the species, or between locations subject to contrasting levels of gene flow in the case of A. constricta. Results of a common garden translocation experiment, coupled with those of previous breeding experiments, suggest that variation in shape is predominantly genetically determined in B. vittatum, but plastic in A. constricta. Plasticity of shape in A. constricta was most pronounced at Albany, where previous data suggested the widest gene flow, and was greater than in B. vittatum at both locations. Change of shape in A. constricta subsequent to translocation was related to growth rate, a trait which was also more plastic in this species than in B. vittatum. The results a ree with the notion that wide dispersal enhances physiological flexibility, while restricted dispersal promotes local genetic adaptation, but disagree with the hypothesis that wide dispersal promotes phenotypic homogeneity.

AB Chrysothamnus nauseosus (Asteraceae) is a complex polymorphic shrub species widely distributed in western North America. In a study of 86 populations belonging to 15 subspecies, achene mass varied among populations over a sevenfold range. Achene mass was closely correlated with capitulum size at the subspecies level, varied little between wild-growing and common-garden-grown members of a population, and was under strong genetic control. Subspecies with the heaviest achenes are restricted to specialized edaphic environments (dunes and badlands) or late seral montane riparian communities, while subspecies that are widely distributed and that occur in early seral habitats have less heavy achenes. Selection on achene mass has apparently been a notable feature of the adaptive radiation of Chrysothamnus nauseosus into the wide array of habitats it currently occupies. Within a wild population, achene mass was greater for plants fruiting in midautumn than for plants fruiting early or late in the autumn, and this same trend was observed within individual plants in garden populations, indicating environmental control, perhaps through resource limitation. Highly significant between-plant differences in achene mass were found in both wild and garden populations, suggesting that within-population genetic variation is sufficient to permit continuing selection.

AB Intraspecific variation in life-history strategy provides a valuable opportunity for examining how natural selection acts on life-history variants to mold reproductive strategies. Evaluating the consequences of selection requires knowledge of the range of phenotypic variation in life histories, the extent to which variation is genetically based, and possible correlations among different traits that might constrain or promote the effect of selection on individual traits. We explored life-history variation in the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri (a cyclical hermaphrodite) by growing clonal replicates of 18 genotypes in a common-garden experiment. Colonies of this species have previously been shown to vary in egg production and growth rate. We demonstrate that genotypes also vary in sperm production, which is manifested as variation in testis size. We then calculate broad-sense heritabilities for a suite of life-history traits and demonstrate correlations among traits that suggest a three-way tradeoff in resource allocation to asexual growth and sexual reproduction via male and female function. This correlation structure suggests that selection cannot act independently on individual life-history traits.

TI A genetic basis for geographic variation in shell morphology in the bay
   scallop, Argopecten irradians
SO MARINE BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
ID LAMARCK; COLOR
AB The bay scallop, Argopecten irradians, exhibits extensive variation in morphology among geographically separated populations, resulting in the recognition of three major subspecies (A. i. irradians, A. i. concentricus, A. i. amplicostatus). The extent to which morphological variation results from differing environmental conditions is unknown. In the present study, bay seal lops from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Florida, and Texas were collected, spawned and the offspring reared in a common garden experiment to determine if scallops cultured under similar environmental conditions exhibited the morphology expected given the geographic origin of their parents. Significant differences among populations were indicated by ANOVA in both the wild-caught (13/14 morphological characters) and cultured (11/14 characters) scallops. Principal components analysis clustered wild-caught scallops according to geographic origin and cultured scallops according to geographic ancestry. The morphological characters most influential in resolving groups were plical width, plical spacing, number of plicae and valve convexity. Geographic variation in morphology apparently has a strong genetic basis, and reflects significant differentiation among disjunct populations of bay scallops.

Deserts are also one of the most climatically unpredictable and heterogeneous biomes; thus, variation of energy balance characters due either to plasticity or genetic differentiation might also be crucial to the success of desert plant species. In a common garden environment we examined variation in the traits associated with energy balance and productivity in Encelia farinosa A. Gray(brittlebush) plants. Comparing two populations from contrasting rainfall and drought climates, we found that plants from the wetter site (Superior, Arizona) always maintained higher leaf absorptances than plants from the more xeric region (Oatman, Arizona) when at similar water potentials. Superior plants also increased stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in response to mid-spring rainfall, whereas Oatman plants did not. Oatman plants, however, tended to have greater leaf areas and continuous spring growth, which made them larger than Superior plants, yet both populations produced the same number of flower heads. The differences for these traits, and the associations among them, agree with predictions based on the contrasting drought and rainfall environments of these two populations. Our results suggest that the differences might represent alternative suites of characters of selective importance for maximizing carbon gain over the climatically variable range of this widespread species. Furthermore, these differences, detected in common environment conditions, might have a genetic basis, which might contribute to a greater potential for local adaptation in this species.

AB We studied the effects of host plant hybridization on the survival and mortality of the leaf-mining moth Phyllonorycter salicifoliella on hybrid and parental willow plants in the field and in a common garden experiment. P. salicifoliella survival differed significantly among three willow taxa in the field in 1994 but not in the field in 1995 or in the common garden. Parasitism by eulophid wasps differed significantly among taxa in 1994 and appeared to account for the variation in their survival. In the field in 1995, host feeding predation varied significant among taxa. The theory of tritrophic interactions predicts that plant genotype can affect natural enemy impact, and this study supports this prediction. Significant variation in survival and eulophid parasitism was also found among genotypes within taxa in the field in both years and in the common garden experiment. The common garden results show that genetic differences in plants affect the herbivore-parasitoid interaction. Variation among years in the patterns of survival and causes of mortality among field plants suggest that genotype by environment interactions may be important.

AB Seedling populations of seven Cupressus taxa were compared in common gardens to assess relationships among taxa and to elucidate the genetic structure of three taxa with different distributions and demographics. Discriminant analyses of 15 quantitative traits separated C. sargentii and C. forbesii from taxa within the C. arizonica complex (C. arizonica, C. glabra, C. stephensonii, C. nevadensis, and C. montana); aligned a population of C. arizonica from Sierra de Arteaga, Mexico, with families of the same taxon from southwestern United States; and described a close relationship between C. nevadensis and C. glabra, but nevertheless separated taxa within the C. arizonica complex. Analyses of wind-pollinated progenies of single trees showed the narrow endemic, C. glabra, to have a greater degree of population differentiation than the more broadly dispersed C. arizonica. In addition, genetic variances within the numerically small populations of C. arizonica were about the same as in the much larger populations of C. glabra. The results also suggested that genetic variability in C. stephensonii, a taxon occurring in a single population,may occur primarily among inbred lines. While the genetic structures of C. arizonica and C. glabra have counterparts among broadly dispersed conifers, that of C. stephensonii appears to be unique. Together, the results support the view that genetic structure primarily reflects the uncertain, chance events that are interspersed throughout evolutionary history.

AB We conducted an experimental study of the effects of nutrient addition on the susceptibility of two species of willows (Salix eriocephala and S. sericea) and their hybrid to a pathogen and several herbivores. We hypothesized that the relative susceptibility of parental and hybrid willows would depend upon soil nutrient availability and vary among plant enemies. Using potted plants in a common garden, we found that S. eriocephala was significantly more susceptible to attack by a fungal rust (Melampsora sp.), a leaf-chewing beetle (Popillia japonica), and a leaf-folding sawfly (Phyllocolpa nigrita) than was S. sericea. Conversely, S. sericea was significantly more susceptible to attack by a spider mite (Tetranychus sp.) and a leaf-mining caterpillar (Phyllocnistis sp.) than was S. eriocephala. Hybrid susceptibility to Melampsora sp. and to Phyllocnistis sp. resembled S. eriocephala's while hybrid susceptibility to Phyllocolpa nigrita, Tetranychus sp., and Popillia japonica resembled S. sericea's. Susceptibility to a sixth enemy, another leaf-mining caterpillar, Phyllonorycter salicifoliella, did not differ among the parents and hybrid. Susceptibility to herbivores and pathogens increased along a gradient of increasing fertilizer application, and this effect was independent of plant taxon or enemy. The results of our study point to the contrasting influences of a taxonomically and functionally diverse enemy community, reinforce the hybrid dominance model of enemy susceptibility, and demonstrate that physiological stress and enemy susceptibility can be inversely related.

AB Gall forming herbivores induce sinks and act as phloem parasites within their host plants. Their performance on the host plant can depend on the sink-source relationship they establish with the plant. Because sink-source relationships within a plant are reflected in its architecture, we examined how architectural differences among cottonwoods might influence the success of the galling aphid, Pemphigus berne. Using cloned cottonwoods in common garden studies, we found three major patterns. First, there is a significant clonal or genetic component to tree architecture; cloned trees grown in a common garden maintain the architecture of parental trees. Second, resistant tree genotypes have more natural sinks (i.e., buds) relative to sources (i.e., stem volume) than susceptible trees. Third, these differences in architecture result in greater competition among sinks on aphid-resistant trees than on aphid-susceptible trees. Sink competition within a tree was estimated by the Gini coefficient which quantifies the size inequality of a shoot population (i.e., competition among sinks is low when shoots are nearly equal in size, and great when a few shoots are large and most are small). Aphid death through gall abortion increased significantly (r(2) = 0.65) on garden-grown trees as competition among sinks within a tree increased. Based on these observations we proposed the ''sink competition hypothesis'' to account for the performance of gall formers on their host plants. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally reduced sink densities (i.e., buds) on branches of resistant tree genotypes to resemble the bud densities of susceptible genotypes. By reducing the number of competing sinks, we predicted that aphid survival would increase. As predicted, aphid survival significantly increased. For example, in one removal experiment, aphid survival increased from 20% on control branches to 55% on branches with the highest level of bud removal. Similar bud removals on susceptible trees did not increase aphid survival, indicating that competition is relaxed on susceptible hosts. With the exception of the plant vigor hypothesis, most current hypotheses explaining herbivore distributions in nature focus on the importance to leaf-chewing herbivores of variation in chemistry. We believe that a sink competition model is needed to explain the distributions of the diverse group of herbivores that act as phloem parasites. The sink competition model is more mechanistic than the vigor hypothesis, and may account for apparent contradictions because it more clearly quantifies the resource base and the potential interactions that occur when sinks, either herbivore-induced or natural, compete for sources.

AB Seed collections along 2 elevational transects, 1 in the central part and the other on the western edge of the Antalya basin were made to study within-and between-population variation for growth characteristics of Pinus brutia TEN.. Four common garden experiments were established at different elevations along the western transect. In addition, seed samples from 4 populations along a third elevational transect on the far eastern edge of the basin were collected to perform isoenzyme analyses. Population parameters for 6-year height growth showed that middle elevation populations have better performance and better uniformity than lower-and higher-elevation populations within each of the 4 test sites. They also exhibit higher adaptational plasticity and higher stability under varying environmental conditions. Furthermore, isoenzyme analyses indicated that middle-elevation populations have a higher heterozygosity level and higher numbers of alleles per locus. Our results based on growth and isoenzyme analyses indicate that middle-elevation populations of P. brutia present higher genetic variability for in situ conservation, and they can serve much wider elevational zones for afforestation and reforestation purposes than the lower and higher elevation populations. Therefore, they should be given high priority in forest tree breeding and selection activities in the region.

AB Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere) seedlings were cultured using two nursery methods of blackout (short photoperiod) application: static treatment (constant day length of 14.28 h) and dynamic treatment (day length varying over length of experiment, with a mean of 14.28 h). Both methods when compared with a control (natural day length) reduced seedling height by inducing terminal bud set, increased seedling root weight, and decreased shoot to root and sturdiness ratios. Both static and dynamic blackout treatment seedlings had 26 and 30% lammas flush, respectively. Compared with control, both methods accelerated cold hardiness acquisition. After winter storage at -2 degrees C, treated seedlings flushed sooner than did control stock under light:dark temperatures of 25:20 degrees C. Under a cooler regime, 15:5 degrees C, differences among treatments were not significant. After planting in a common garden trial, terminal bud phenology had a range of treatment responses. Control seedlings flushed later and set bud sooner. Dynamic treatment seedlings bud set phenology was nearest to that of controls. At a common garden trial and a reforestation site, blackout-treated seedlings had greater first-season terminal height increment. Planting check was observed for all treatments in the field during the second and third growing seasons. After five field seasons there was no height difference among treatments, and survival averaged 87%. Groundline stem diameter was never different among treatments. Biologically, the dynamic treatment is intermediate between the static and control treatments, but the static treatment is recommended because it is easier to apply in the nursery, and differences between the dynamic and static treatments were minimal.

AB 1. Models of tree function and forest ecosystem carbon budgets often assume that potential global changes in temperature and/or other factors may alter tissue nitrogen (N) and dark respiration rates (R(d)). However, little is known of patterns of co-variation in tissue N and R(d) among intraspecific populations originating along climatic gradients, and of whether an N-based model of R(d) can link these two variables. To address these issues, we studied N and R(d) in fully expanded needles of 10-year-old trees of 14 Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) populations of wide-ranging origin (43 degrees to 60 degrees N), grown under common garden conditions.
   2. For 11 lowland populations (elevation <200 m) from the contiguous part of the species range (48 degrees to 60 degrees N) grown at a field site in Kornik, western Poland (52 degrees N), there were greater needle %N in populations from increasing latitude of origin or decreasing mean annual temperature (r greater than or equal to 0.93, P<0.01). Similar %N and latitude of origin correlations were observed in another year at this site and in retrospective analyses of published data for different sets of Scots Pine populations grown in common gardens at 48 degrees, 52 degrees C and 62 degrees N latitudes. Needle R(d) rates of the 11 lowland populations growing at Kornik and measured at a common temperature (20 degrees C) were greater, by as much as 50%, for more northerly than southerly populations. Mean R(d) rates were positively correlated to latitude of origin and to mean annual temperature (P<0.05, r=0.7 to 0.8). R(d) and needle %N were positively correlated (P<0.01, r=0.75), with one relationship fitting all data. Across the entire range from 1.15 to 1.55 needle %N, R(d) increased from 4.5 to 6.9 nmol g(-1) s(-1).
   3. Mean needle %N and R(d) values for two montane southern populations (43 degrees and 44 degrees N, elevation greater than or equal to 885 m) growing in the same common garden at Kornik were consistent with the relationships between mean annual temperature, needle %N and R(d) observed for the more northerly populations but did not fit the latitudinal patterns. This suggests that temperature and/or associated climate variables are likely the driving force for observed genetic variation in Scots Pine needle %N and R(d) across latitudinal and altitudinal gradients.
   4. Results of these common garden studies support the idea of a general relationship between needle dark respiration and N concentration, and indicate that there is intraspecific genetic variation in physiology that is selected by climate that persists in a common environment, resulting in higher needle %N and respiration in plants originating from colder habitats. Such patterns need to be better understood and quantified, and merit consideration in modelling of current and potential global change effects on plant function and global carbon cycles.

DT Article
ID NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO
AB To improve our understanding of adaptive variation in jack pine, Pinus banksiana Lamb, from north central Ontario, 64 seed sources were grown in three common garden tests, and relationships were determined between seedling performance and environment at seed origin. Twenty-three growth and phenological variables were studied, including seedling heights, needle flushing dates, timing of shoot elongation, fall foliage colour change, and drought survival. Significant components of variation were expressed among seed sources for all growth traits and many phenological characters. Linear regressions were run between seedling traits and climatic variables as well as spatial, soil, and vegetative variables that described the environment at seed origin. Resulting coefficients of determination were as high as 0.30. Principal component analysis was used to summarize the variation, with 33% and 21% of the variation accounted for by the first and second components, respectively. Regressions and mapping of principal component analysis scores indicated that the patterns of variation in this portion of the range of jack pine were clinal in nature: the patterns could be predicted by environment at seed origin. The greater growth potential of seedlings from the southwestern portion of the range, in contrast with those of the north shore of Lake Superior, reflected clinal trends seen in previous studies. Multiple regressions were run on the first and second sets of factor scores produced from principal component analysis against the climate variables, resulting in coefficients of determination of 0.30 and 0.38, respectively. Including soil and vegetative variables in the models resulted in only slightly higher coefficients. Thus, climate at seed origin should be considered as the prime factor when seed transfers are necessary in this area.

AB Dispersal is considered a vital life history characteristic for insects exploiting temporary habitats, and life history theorists have often hypothesized an inverse relationship between dispersal capability and habitat persistence. Most often, this hypothesis has been tested using interspecific comparisons of dispersal capability and qualitative estimates of habitat persistence. Consequently, most assessments have failed to control for possible phylogenetic nonindependence and they also lack quantitative rigor.
   We capitalized on existing intraspecific variation in the dispersal capability of Prokelisia planthoppers to examine the relationship between habitat persistence and dispersal, thereby minimizing possible phylogenetic effects. Two congeneric species (Prokelisia marginata and P. dolus) occur in the intertidal marshes of North America, where they feed exclusively on cordgrasses (Spartina). Because these planthoppers exhibit wing dimorphism, flight-capable adults (macropters with fully developed wings) are easily differentiated from flightless adults (brachypters with reduced wings). Thus, dispersal capability can be readily estimated by the percentage of macropters in a population.
   At a regional spatial scale, we found a highly significant negative relationship between dispersal capability (percent macroptery) and habitat persistence. In this system, habitat persistence is influenced by a combination of marsh elevation, winter severity, and tidal range, which interact to determine the ability of planthoppers to endure through winter in their primary habitat for development. P. marginata develops primarily in low-marsh habitats during summer, habitats that can be subjected to pronounced winter disturbance due to ice scouring and/or extensive tidal inundation. Levels of winter disturbance of the low marsh are extreme along the Atlantic coast, intermediate along the Pacific, and low along the Gulf. Both the failure of P. marginata populations to remain through winter in this habitat, and the dispersal ability of these populations (92%, 29%, and 17% macroptery, respectively), are correlated with levels of disturbance. Thus, in regions where winter disturbance is high, levels of dispersal are correspondingly high to allow for recolonization of extirpated habitats from overwintering sites on the high marsh. Unlike P. marginata, P. dolus develops primarily in high-marsh habitats, which are much less disturbed on all coasts during winter. Consequently, this species remains year-round in its primary habitat for development, and most populations exhibit relatively low levels of macroptery (<10%).
   When raised under common garden conditions, many more macropters of both species were produced from Atlantic compared to Gulf populations. Thus the proportion of macropters produced from the populations used in this experiment paralleled the incidence of macroptery measured in the field, providing evidence that the geographic variation in dispersal capability in both species has in part a genetic basis. The results of this study provide strong intraspecific evidence for an inverse relationship between the dispersal capability of insects and the persistence of their habitats.

AB Seedling growth and morphology are thought to reflect evolutionary responses to habitat or influences of seed size. To test these hypotheses? we selected fourteen species of North American oaks differing in soil moisture habitat preference and seed size. Seedlings were grown for 1-2 years with abundant soil water and moderate soil nutrition in pots placed outdoors and in a common garden. Oak species native to xeric environments produced the smallest seedlings. Oaks from hydric soils had more shoot weight per unit of root weight and more height per unit of total plant weight than did mesic or xeric oaks. Essentially no differences in leaf area per unit of total plant weight were detected. Species with thinner and larger individual leaves tended to produce larger seedlings. Within species, seed size was generally unrelated to seedling growth, although results may have been complicated by uncontrolled genotypic variability. However, when species were compared, those with larger mean seed size produced larger seedlings. Root/shoot allometry, height growth and leaf thickness in the tested species may reflect evolutionary responses to soil moisture and flooding. Although seed size influenced seedling growth, no clear relationship between seed size and soil moisture habitat was found.

AB A common-garden study of Populus trichocarpa Torr. and Gray was initiated in 1985 when material from 128 trees was collected along two mesic (Hoh and Nisqually) and two xeric (Dungeness and Yakima) river valleys. In spring 1986 cuttings were used to establish two replicate plantations, at Puyallup and at Wenatchee, WA. For 2 years trees were assessed for timing of spring flush, autumn budset and leaf fall, and incidence of Melampsora occidentalis leaf rust. Seasonal patterns varied with trait, plantation, year, and origin of clones. Significant differences were found mainly between clones from the lower and upper elevations of the Nisqually (LN, UN) and Yakima (LY, UY). At both plantations, clones from the cooler UN flushed later than those from the LN. In contrast, cool canyon climates of some sites along the LY resulted in later spring flush of lower than upper clones. Factors affecting patterns of autumn phenology differed between trees from those river valleys. Later budset in LN vs. UN trees was again related to cold affecting the growing season length, but earlier budset and leaf fall in LY than UY clones at Puyallup was brought about by higher rust infection. The greater rust susceptibility of LY material likely reflects lower rust pressure in the more arid lower Yakima valley, Soil moisture deficit and the presence/absence of rust at the plantations also contributed to autumn phenology patterns. Genetic variances were large for all traits at Puyallup. In Yakima trees, the large group component of the genetic variance (elevational group, clone) in leaf fall and rust points to a steep selection gradient along the Yakima. A similarly steep gradient seems also to influence spring flush along the Nisqually. Heritabilities indicate moderately to very strong genetic control in these traits. The patterns of genetic variation have implications for short-rotation intensive-culture forestry and management of natural populations.

AB We performed reciprocal transplants of different Borrichia clones between offshore islands in Pinellas County, Florida, to assess the relative strengths of environment and genotype on the success of the gall midge Asphondylia borrichiae. We measured gall abundance, gall size, gall abortion rate, parasitism rate, stem-tip diameter, nitrogen level, and parasitoid community composition from both experimental and native plants. We found a significant effect of plant clone and environment on all these variables with the exception of gall abortion rate. The effect of environment was usually stronger than that of genotype. This is an unusual result. At sites with higher densities of galls, plants were higher in nitrogen, had bigger stem tips, and produced larger galls. Bigger galls suffered lower parasitism because the smallest species of the parasitoid guild, which is also the most common species, was largely excluded from large galls. The interaction between plant clone and environment was significant for all variables, including abortion rate, which indicates that plant responses, herbivore density, and herbivore mortality are phenotypically plastic. while some authors have found significant interactions between plant genotype and site on herbivore densities, the demonstration of similar phenomena on natural-enemy attack rates and abortion rates of galls is novel. at least for a natural system. In this system, ''bottom-up'' factors indirectly determine the strength of ''top-down'' central from parasitoids, by regulating the size of galls.

AB Stem respiration rates of 31-year-old jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) trees from northern and southern provenances growing in a common garden were compared. At 15 degrees C, the seasonal course of stem respiration rate of northern provenances was not statistically different from that of southern provenances. A relationship existed between maintenance respiration rate and stem growth rate. Because relationships between sapwood relative growth rate and annual growth and maintenance respiration rates were similar for northern and southern provenances, no clinal differences in stem respiration rates were observed.

AB Individual barnyardgrass plants were grown in the absence of competition in a common garden environment. Cohorts were initiated in mid-March, late April, early June, mid-July mid-August, and mid-September, Plants within a cohort varied from prostrate to upright. Early and late cohorts required slightly longer to achieve flowering and seed shatter than those initiated in late spring and early summer. The onset and development of senescence varied by as much as 5 wk between individuals within a cohort, and senescence progressed more rapidly for plants in later cohorts. Longest tiller length per plant averaged 150 cm and did not differ by cohort, but within cohort variation was approximately 33%. The number of tillers per plant declined with increasing delay in cohort initiation; within cohort variation exceeded 40%. Leaf numbers decreased from more than 10,000 per plant to less than 400 per plant with increasing delay in cohort initiation date, Individuals within a cohort had more than two-fold variation in leaf numbers. The number of inflorescences decreased from more than 4500 per plant to less than 100 with increasing delay in cohort initiation. Mean inflorescence length and frequency of different inflorescence lengths per plant varied between plants within a cohort. Vegetative biomass exceeded 3000 g for many plants in the early cohorts, and decreased to less than 25 g per plant for some individuals in the September cohort. More than twofold variation in biomass occurred between plants within a cohort, Plasticity in morphology and phenology may contribute to the success of barnyardgrass as a weed.

AB Analysis of life history evolution in spatially heterogeneous environments was revolutionized by the demonstration by Kawecki & Steams (1993) and Houston & McNamara (1992) that earlier treatments had used incorrect fitness measures. The implications of this for the analysis of organisms with and without phenotypic plasticity are reviewed. It is shown that analyses ignoring age structure can give misleading results. The plausibility and implications of the assumptions are discussed, and suggestions are made for further work. The usefulness of reciprocal transplant and common garden experiments, in providing information relevant to the assumptions and predictions, is emphasized.
   Two simulation studies show that life history evolution in temporally heterogeneous environments in which trade-offs are fixed are well predicted by Schaffer's (1974) model, with modification for asymmetric variations as necessary. Unfortunately the period of study needed to observe such effects is so long as to preclude experimental tests for most organsims.

AB We investigated the effects of prolonged starvation on body weight and shell thickness, on the numbers of different types of cells, and on the Mg/Ca ratio in the digestive gland and shell in the common garden snail Helix aspersa Muller. A 60% reduction in body weight, which occurred after periods of starvation longer than 3 months, was critical for life. Starvation had a marked effect on the relative numbers of cells in the digestive gland, and significantly decreased the number of digestive cells. The changes in Mg/Ca ratio in the digestive gland and shell were closely correlated. Changes in ion balance may have resulted from the need to compensate for the starvation-induced decline in extracellular pH. The shell acted as a reservoir of ions that could be mobilized under extreme conditions.

AB Life-history variation was studied in three sympatric species of Stylopoma Levinsen [S. spongites (Pallas), S. projecta Canu and Bassler and Stylopoma n. sp. 15] in Panama. Bryozoan colonies were collected from 27 reefs along 300 km of the Caribbean coast of Panama. The distribution and abundance of each species were very patchy, but with broad overlap in occurrence among localities and depths. Nevertheless, species differed considerably in colony size, size at first reproduction and numbers of brooding larvae; implying that interspecific differences in life-history traits may contribute to their coexistence. To examine closely this variation in life-history patterns, we grew, in a common garden experiment, the offspring of the two most common species that were obtained from parent colonies collected from several reefs. There were highly significant differences in growth rates and the timing and extent of sexual reproduction which corresponded well to patterns observed in individuals from the field. Other factors, including size of larvae, extent of secondary zooidal calcification and numbers of avicularia were also correlated with differences in life histories. Despite this additional complexity, however, ecological consequences of trade-offs in life history among modular species such as Stylopoma spp. appear very similar to those among unitary species.

AB Kunzea ericoides populations from 25 locations in New Zealand and two in Australia, and a Kunzea sinclairii population from Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, were grown in two plantings at Lincoln, New Zealand. Years to first flowering and times and duration of flowering each year differed significantly between populations. Flowering time was advanced by higher temperature sums in July-December but retarded by this factor in January-June. Flowering duration increased as plants aged. Most populations that flowered first at an early age also did so earlier and for longer in each flowering season than populations that were less precocious. Several groupings of populations with different reproductive strategies, ranging from quick maturing and profusely flowering to slow maturing and sparsely flowering, could be derived according to their region of origin. The Australian populations were characterised by their synchronous and profuse flowering. For a southern New Zealand group of populations, flowering rime was delayed as latitude of origin increased. South Island populations showed both regional and site-specific adaptations of reproductive strategies. Variation in flowering synchrony of individual plants in populations and correlation of individual shrub flowering in different years were observed. It is hypothesised that this variation underlies adaptation to the probability of conditions favourable for flower maturation at the sites of origin.

AB A laboratory protocol to quantify damage from a sudden increase in ultraviolet-B irradiance (UV-B, waveband 280-320 nm) to cucumber (cv. Poinsett) seedlings, including saturating photosynthetically active irradiance (400-700 nm, 1200 mu mol/m(2)/s), was determined using leaf chlorophyll alpha fluorescence measurements to estimate photoinhibition. Seedlings of six native New Zealand tree species, grown in a common garden, were irradiated for 4 h, receiving a total biologically-effective UV-B dose of 17 kJ/m(2) or about twice that on a clear summer day in New Zealand. There was a wide range of responses to an increase in UV-B irradiance including a 20% increase in photoinhibition for two shade tolerant species and 10% increase for the shade intolerant red beech (Nothofagus fusca). The other species were not affected. Mountain beech (N. solandri var. cliffortioides) was particularly tolerant of high UV-B doses. Leaf and epidermal thickness, and flavonoid concentration did not correspond well with species response.

AB Both ecological and genetic mechanisms have been proposed to explain patterns of herbivore attack on interspecific plant hybrids, but distinguishing among them can be difficult in natural hybrid zones. We per formed a common-garden experiment to evaluate four genetic hypotheses: dominance, additivity, elevated hybrid susceptibility, and elevated hybrid resistance. Censuses and cage experiments were used to compare insect responses to basin big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp. tridentata), mountain big sagebrush (A. t. vaseyana), and their F-2 progeny. After two growing seasons, hybrid shrubs resembled mountain big sagenbrush in size, but were more similar to basin big sagebrush in flower production. Censuses of naturally colonizing insects (the gall midge Rhopalomyia obovata, the bagworm moth Apterona helix, and the aphid Obtusciauda coweni) tended to support the dominance hypothesis: if the insect clearly discriminated between the two parents, its frequency on hybrids closely resembled that on one of the parents. Moreover, colonization of hybrids in all three cases suggested a dominance deviation toward the susceptible parent rather than toward the resistant parent. In contrast to the censuses, cage experiments involving two insects supported the hybrid-susceptibility hypothesis; both survival and growth of the grasshopper Melanoplus sanguinipes and growth of the leaf beetle Trirhabda pilosa were higher on hybrid shrubs than on either parent. Because many secondary compounds have been determined to occur at intermediate concentrations in F-2 shrubs, dominance for susceptibility may indicate that insects respond to plant traits (e.g., oviposition stimulants and deterrents) in a threshold manner. Mechanisms underlying increased hybrid susceptibility are less clear, but our experimental design makes environmental explanations (e.g., the plant-stress hypothesis) unlikely. Although we eliminated several confounding factors, our results agree with the conclusion from natural hybrid zones that insect responses to hybrid plants are likely to be idiosyncratic; even congeneric species did not respond similarly to hybrid and parental plants.

DE black spruce; Picea mariana; adaptive variation; focal point seed zones
AB The results of a recent study of adaptive variation of black spruce in northwestern Ontario, together with additional freezing damage data, were used to produce regression-based focal point seed zones for this species. The procedure required two data bases as follows: (i) the biological data derived from two common garden growth trials, one greenhouse trial, and freezing trials of 75 black spruce seed sources and (ii) climatic data for the period 1951-1980. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to summarize the main components of growth and freezing variation, and the PCA axis scores for the seed sources were regressed against climatic variables. The regression equations were used to model the patterns of adaptive variation, and these patterns were graphically reproduced as contour maps by a geographic information system (GIS). A series of focal point seed zone maps for black spruce was produced by GIS intersection of the regression-based contour maps. Focal point seed zones were more restricted in the south near Lake Superior, reflecting the more rapidly changing climate in this part of the study area. Since black spruce is closely adapted to local climate, these results will be useful to formulate successful seed transfers in this area. There are additional potential applications for matching seed sources to changing climates and for the identification of genetically unique populations.

AB The study involved the measurement of stable-carbon isotope discrimination and specific leaf area on foliage of mature trees of 11 conifer species grown in a common-garden in eastern Nebraska, USA. Each species was represented by three to six trees from at least three populations. Carbon isotope discrimination differed significantly among species (F = 31.41, P < 0.0001) and among populations within species (F = 1.65, P < 0.035). Of the all Species, members of the Pinaceae family (Abies, Larix, Picea, Pinus, Pseudotsuga) had much higher discrimination (Delta = 18.87, SE = 0.08, n = 141) than species in the Cupressaceae family (Juniperus) (Delta = 16.26, SE = 0.12, n = 18). A deciduous conifer, Larix (Delta = 19.09, SE = 0.20, n = 16), did not differ significantly from evergreen members of the Pinaceae family. Although specific leaf area differed among species (F = 152.62, P < 0.0001), it was not correlated with discrimination (r = 0.24, P > 0.14). Annual height growth, specific leaf area, and annual precipitation of seed sources were intercorrelated (0.60 less than or equal to r less than or equal to 0.67, P < 0.01). No correlation was significant between Delta and the precipitation or evapotranspiration of the seed sources. The results indicate that these species have different genetic structures and acclimation processes. Selecting for better adapted genotypes based on carbon isotope discrimination must be species specific.

AB We have examined patterns of variation of several kinds of molecular markers (isozymes, RFLPs of ribosomal DNA and anonymous low-copy number DNA, RAPDs and microsatellites) and an adaptive trait [date of bud set in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)]. The study included Finnish Scots pine populations (from latitude 60 degrees N to 70 degrees N) which experience a steep climatic gradient. Common garden experiments show that these populations are adapted to the location of their origin and genetically differentiated in adaptive quantitative traits, e.g. the date of bud set in first-year seedlings. In the northernmost population, bud set took place about 21 days earlier than in the southernmost population. Of the total variation in bud set, 36.4% was found among the populations. All molecular markers showed high levels of within-population variation, while differentiation among populations was low. Among all the studied markers, microsatellites were the most variable ((H) over bar(e)=0.77). Differences between populations were small, G(ST) was less than 0.02. Our study suggests that molecular markers may be poor predictors of the population differentiation of quantitative traits in Scots pine, as exemplified here by bud-set date.

AB There is abundant evidence that evergreen conifers living at high elevations or at high latitudes have longer-lived needles than trees of the same species living elsewhere. This pattern is likely caused by the influence of low temperature in combination with related factors such as a shea growing season and low nutrient availability. Because it is not known to what degree such patterns result from phenotypic versus genotypic variation, we evaluated needle longevity for common-garden-grown lowland populations of European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) of wide latitudinal origin and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.) of wide elevational origin. Nine-year-old trees of 16 Scots pine populations ranging in origin from 47 degrees to 60 degrees N were studied in Kornik, Poland (52 degrees N) and 18-year-old trees of 18 Norway spruce populations ranging in origin from 670 to 1235 m elevation in southwestern Poland were studied near Morawina, Poland (51 degrees N, 180 m elevation). There was no tendency in either species for populations from northern or high elevation origins to retain needles longer than other populations. All of the Scots pine populations had between 2.5 to 3.0 needle age cohorts and all of the Norway spruce populations had between 6.4 and 7.2 needle age cohorts. Thus, extended needle retention in Scots pine and Norway spruce populations in low-temperature habitats at high elevations and high latitudes appears to be largely an environmentally regulated phenotypic acclimation.

AB Genetic variation in mono- and sesquiterpenes of foliage was determined in the Pinus nigra complex. Samples were obtained from 41 populations in nine regions from western Europe (Cevennes, Pyrenees, Corsica, Abruzzia, Calabria, Alps, Sicily, Peloponesia, Pinde). A total of 39 terpenoids were detected, with alpha-pinene the dominant monoterpene and germacrene-D the dominant sesquiterpene. All terpenes exhibited significant geographic variation. Insular populations were unique in containing low levels of beta-pinene and unusually high amounts of linalyl acetate. The long isolation of populations in these regions (especially Corsica), and the peculiarities of their terpenoid composition, support the hypothesis that they represent the most original form of black pine (dating to the Tertiary). Variation patterns within the continental range, especially in zones of overlap with other pines (with hybridization and introgression) may provide information about the evolutionary history of black pine.

AB Leaf morphology has been the subject of several studies in Nothofagus especially in the context of the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships of taxa within the genus, which are still controversial. The leaf architecture of N. dombeyi, N. betuloides and N. nitida, dominant trees of temperate forest in southern South America, is compared using venation patterns, landmarks, and entire outlines. In terms of venation patterns N. dombeyi and N. betuloides were more similar to each other than to N. nitida. Similar results were Found when differences in shape were analysed by discriminant analyses of shape coordinates (landmarks) and Fourier coefficients (outlines). For both analyses, the first discriminant function separated N. nitida from the other two species; these were also distinguished but showed greater overlap with each other. This study, in conceit with information from allozyme data confirms the hypothesis of a more ancestral position for N. nitida with N. dombeyi and N. betuloides being more recently derived. In addition to differences in shape, the size component of leaf morphology indicated that whereas N. betuloides had the smallest leaves, N. dombeyi spanned the greatest range and has the biggest leaves. Given that the data shown here were obtained from seedlings grown under common-garden conditions, differences in both shape and size, seem to be important components of leaf morphology that may warrant consideration in characterizing these and other species of Nothofagus.

AB We examine how the distribution of a leaf-galling aphid (Pemphigus betae ) affects other species associated with natural stands of hybrid cottonwoods (Populus angustifolisa x P. fermontii). Aphid transfers on common-garden clones and RFLP analysis show that resistance to aphids in cottonwoods is affected by plant genotype. Because susceptible trees typically support thousands of galls, while adjacent resistant trees have few or none, plant resistance traits that affect the distribution of this abundant herbivore may directly and/or indirectly affect other species. We found that the arthropod community of aphid-susceptible trees had 31% greater species richness and 26% greater relative abundance than aphid-resistant trees. To examine direct and indirect effects of plant resistance traits on other organisms, we experimentally excluded aphids and found that abundances and/or foraging behavior of arthropods, fungi, and birds were altered, First, exclusion of gall aphids on susceptible trees resulted in a 24% decrease in species richness and a 28% decrease in relative abundance of the arthropod community Second, exclusion of aphids also caused a 2- to 3-fold decrease in foraging and/or presence of three taxa of aphid enemies: birds, fungi, and insects. Lastly, aphid-exclusion resulted in a 2-fold increase in inquilines (animals who live in abodes properly belonging to another). We also found that fungi and birds responded to variation in gall density at the branch level. We conclude plant resistance traits affect diverse species from three trophic levels supporting a ''bottom-up'' influence of plants on community structure.

AB We used a common garden experiment to determine if local populations of Jordan's salamander (Plethodon jordani) vary in levels of intraspecific aggression. Levels of aggression did not differ significantly among six populations in the northern, central, and southern portions of the range of P. jordani. In addition, levels of aggression in paired populations in close proximity to each other were no more similar than those in paired populations selected from throughout the range of P, jordani. Levels of aggression increased with the absolute size of the contestants in one intensively studied population; however, the mean size of individuals did not differ significantly among the six populations that were compared.

AB The magnitude of inbreeding depression caused by recessive mutations in a population is dependent on the mutation rate and on the intensity of selection against the mutations. We studied geographical differences in the level of early inbreeding depression of Scots pine in a common garden experiment. The mean abortion rate of experimentally self-pollinated seeds was significantly lower (75.4%) among trees that originated from northern populations (66-69 degrees N) than among trees from more southern (60-62 degrees N) populations (86.5%). Thus, the number of embryonic lethal equivalents was lower in the northern populations (4.5) than in the southern ones (6.9). The outcrossing rate at the mature seed stage was slightly lower in the northern populations (average 0.93) than in the southern one (0.99). The estimated selfing rate at the zygote stage varied from 0-0.28 in the populations. The reduction in the magnitude of inbreeding depression in the north may have been caused by increased levels of self-fertilization in the northern populations. The proportion of self-fertilized seedlings and adults was very small in all populations (F approximate to 0), indicating high inbreeding depression also in later life stages. The high level of inbreeding depression in the partially selfing Scots pine can be explained by mutation-selection balance only if the mutation rate is high.

AB The aim of this paper is to report on how a complex pathosystem, consisting of the plant (Plantago lanceolata), the weevil (Trichosirocalus troglodytes) and the fungus (Diaporthe adunca) functions in natural populations. In laboratory and garden experiments the weevil has previously been shown to transmit the fungus to the spikes of P. lanceolata, where infection usually starts. However, the interactions of this pathosystem in natural situations were unknown, for example, if the weevil and the fungus occur at the same place and time. To study this as well as the preference of the weevil and the fungus for certain environmental conditions, transects at 23 locations in the Netherlands were laid out. The effect of one of the environmental factors namely the mowing regime on epidemics of the fungus was experimentally tested in a hayfield. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that weevil and fungus preferred the same habitat. However, the data obtained during two years in 13 permanent transects, showed that the weevil was only active in spring and that the epidemic reached its maximum in autumn. These findings together with additional, circumstantial evidence presented suggest that the weevil does not play an important role in the transmission of the fungus in natural situations. The experiment with the mowing regimes showed that active management can exert an important effect on epidemics of the fungus. The later the vegetation is mown, the lower the level of disease at the end of the season. Late mowing can be seen as having a sanitary effect and might have negative consequences for disease occurrence in the long run.

AB Aspects of the water relations of three oak species (Quercus gambelii, Q turbinella and Q macrocarpa) and their hybrids (Q gambeliix turbinella, Q gambelii x macrocarpa) were observed under common garden conditions in northern Utah, USA. In the absence of summer moisture inputs, Q macrocarpa and Q turbinella were unable to maintain active gas exchange through the day; following an early morning peak, leaf conductances to water vapor remained very low through the remainder of the day. In contrast, Q gambelii and the hybrids were able to maintain high leaf conductances throughout this period. Consistent with these observations, Q gambelii is thought to have a root system penetrating to the deeper, winter-recharged layers, a feature apparently absent in both Q macrocarpa or Q turbinella. Based on current hybrid distributions, both Q turbinella and Q macrocarpa once extended into drier more northerly regions than they occupy at present. When these parents retreated, they left behind hybrids with Q gambelii, which do not depend on monsoonal moisture input. Leaf size, leaf longevity, carbon isotope ratio, and minimum winter temperatures appear not to be correlated with the absence of Q macrocarpa and Q turbinella from summer-dry habitats. Instead it appears that reliance on summer monsoon events is one of the critical factors influencing loss of these oaks from summer-dry sites in the intermountain west.

AB The study of natural plant populations has provided some of the strongest and most convincing cases of the operation of natural selection currently known, partly because of amenability to reciprocal transplant experiments, common garden work, and long-term in situ manipulation. Genetic differentiation among plant populations over small scales (a few cm to a few hundred cm) has been documented and is reviewed here, in herbaceous annuals and perennials, woody perennials, aquatics, terrestrials, narrow endemics, and widely distributed species. Character differentiation has been documented for most important features of plant structure and function. Examples are known for seed characters, leaf traits, phenology, physiological and biochemical activities, heavy metal tolerance, herbicide resistance, parasite resistance, competitive ability, organellar characters, breeding systems, and life history. Among the forces that have shaped these patterns of differentiation are toxic soils, fertilizers, mowing and grazing, soil moisture, temperature, light intensity, pollinating vectors, parasitism, gene flow, and natural dynamics. The breadth and depth of the evidence reviewed here strongly support the idea that natural selection is the principal force shaping genetic architecture in natural plant populations; that view needs to be more widely appreciated than it is at present.

AB Distributions of common species of Eucalyptus in south-eastern Australia are related to gradients in temperature and rainfall. To determine whether intrinsic water-use efficiency (as indexed by carbon isotope discrimination, Delta) or other leaf attributes were related to climate of native habitats, we sampled 17 populations representing 14 species of Eucalyptus growing in a common garden in southcentral New South Wales. Phreatophytes were clearly distinguished from populations that are totally dependent upon soil moisture derived from rainfall by having higher Delta at a particular level of rainfall. Among 12 non-phreatophytic populations (11 species), Delta was positively correlated with mean annual precipitation (r = 0.75, P = 0.005), December-March precipitation (r = 0.79, P = 0.002), an index of annual soil moisture (r = 0.81, P = 0.001) and seasonality of precipitation (r = 0.85, P < 0.001). There were similarly strong but negative correlations between Delta and potential evaporation during the summer months, but Delta was not correlated with annual potential evaporation of the source sites. Leaf mass per unit area (rho(l)) was negatively correlated with indices of water availability, positively correlated with nitrogen per unit leaf area (r = 0.90, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated with Delta (r = -0.73, P = 0.007). Delta was negatively correlated with area-based leaf nitrogen (r = -0.79, P = 0.002). These complementary correlations among Delta, rho(l), and nitrogen per unit leaf area indicate that variation in Delta may stem largely from variation in photosynthetic capacity. The results provide strong evidence that variation in Delta and rho(l) reflect genetic adaptations to native habitats.

AB A preliminary study was undertaken to reveal ecotypic differentiation in jack pine and black spruce corresponding to ecological land classification groups. Seed sources of jack pine (64) and black spruce (68) from northwestern Ontario were classified according to Vegetation Types (V-Types) and Soil Types (S-Types) defined by the Forest Ecosystem Classification (FEC) developed by the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry Canada for northwestern Ontario. Two short-term common garden field trials and a greenhouse trial were established for each species. Significant differences were present among ecological groupings of seed sources for both species. These differences were expressed according to V-Types and S-Types based on first, second, and third year heights as well as needle flushing dates for jack pine and second year growth increments for black spruce. Rank differences among the groups based on FEC V-Types and S-Types were generally consistent for each of the two species although certain groups showed rank reversals at the two field trials. Apparently, selection pressures corresponding to different FEC V-Types and S-Types have resulted in a detectable pattern of adaptive variation for both jack pine and black spruce in northwestern Ontario. However, the management implications for these two species are uncertain since additional tests are required to verify these results.

AB Common garden testing of populations of different origin started with forest trees more than two hundred years ago. Since then, so-called provenance tests have been established with most commercially important species. Beyond the strictly silvicultural goals, the tests offer excellent opportunities to study intraspecific genetic variation patterns and represent probably the most powerful available tool for testing hypotheses of climatic adaptation in trees.
   Analysis of adaptive traits (mostly juvenile height growth) in provenance experiments indicate the existence of very effective constraints on adaptedness. The performance of populations plotted against an ecological-climatic factor exhibits a characteristic pattern and can be described by response functions. The population average of a fitness-related trait for a locally adapted population is often significantly lower than that of populations from other environments; usually the ones from milder climate perform better. The phenomenon is interpreted as adaptation lag. Suboptimal adaptation is compensated by a high level of genetic diversity. Molecular genetic studies confirm the high level of allelic and individual genetic diversity in forest trees. A consequence of individual homeostasis, phenotypic stability of populations is usually also high; the sensitivity to environmental changes is generally moderate. Phenotypically stable populations are valuable not only because of a wider ran but specifically because of a greater ability to adjust to unexpected changes. This trait should receive more attention in the future for obvious reasons.
   The maintenance of a high within-population genetic variance is favored by the genetic system of the investigated species (effective gene flow, outbreeding, high gene tic load, etc.). Random events and long-lasting biotic interactions are further effects impairing the efficiency of natural selection.
   In view of expected climate instability, genetic adaptability of forest trees causes serious concern due to their long lifespan compared to the rapidity of expected changes in environmental conditions. The potential of provenance tests to interpret long-term adaptational processes should be utilized to analyze, model and predict response of trees to climate change. Although seldomly appreciated, provenance research might be among the most important contributions of forestry to biological sciences.

AB Plant populations in extreme conditions differ from those in more favorable conditions in many respects. They have developed special physiological adaptations for withstanding e.g. extreme temperatures or drought. On the other hand, low survival and fertility may cause smaller effective population sizes, which in turn influences patterns of genetic variation. Scots pine has the widest range of all pine species, extending in the north far beyond the arctic circle. Close to the tree limit, the growing season is short and survival is low. Very northern populations also have lower and more irregular male and female flowering and seed production than southern ones. The consequences of these conditions on genetic variation have been examined. All Finnish populations have similar patterns of variation at allozyme loci and nuclear DNA markers: high variation but no differentiation between populations. Northern populations seem to have slightly fewer recessive deleterious alleles than southern ones. There is, however, strong differentiation between populations with respect to adaptation to the very short growing season. In common garden experiments, northern populations cease growth and set buds much earlier and develop frost tolerance earlier than southern populations. The genetic basis for this high differentiation in bud set can be explored by using dense maps of molecular markers. The implications of these patterns of variations on conservation of genetic resources and tree breeding will be discussed.

AB The relative effect of diffusional resistance due to water films (r(wf)) and leaf anatomy (r(p)) on rates of net photosynthesis and on-line measures of carbon isotope discrimination (Delta = Delta delta C-13) was investigated in Sphagnum. Sphagnum species differ in the exposure of photosynthetic cells at the leaf surface. In S. affine, photosynthetic cells are widely exposed at the surface, whereas in S. magellanicum, photosynthetic cells are enclosed within water-filled hyaline cells. This difference is expected to lead to variation in diffusive resistance within leaves (r(p)). Net photosynthesis and on-line Delta were measured at two water contents: greenhouse water content (wet) and blotted dry (dry). Without correcting for respiration, on-line Delta values differed significantly between wet (23.7 parts per thousand) and dry (30.9 parts per thousand) plants. However, there was no significant difference between species means and no species x water content interaction. Corrections for respiration lowered Delta values by approximately 8.1 parts per thousand and reduced the mean difference to 3.1 parts per thousand, but did not alter the rank order of treatments. Net photosynthesis also decreased by 16% in wet plants, but there was no significant difference between the two species. In addition, five populations of S. affine and S. magellanicum grown in a common garden were analysed for their organic matter carbon isotope composition (delta C-13). These values varied more within each species (0.9-1.2 parts per thousand) than between the two species (0.6 parts per thousand). Therefore, we conclude that variation in surface water films leads to a greater difference in resistance to CO2 uptake and carbon isotope discrimination than that due to variation in leaf anatomical properties in Sphagnum.

AB Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia Nutt.) is a shade-tolerant gymnosperm native to the western United States and Canada. It recently gained attention as the source of Taxol(R) (paclitaxel), a promising new anticancer drug. Large-scale harvest of mature Pacific yew trees for the extraction of paclitaxel has resulted in the need for improved forest management practices and an increased understanding of the amount and distribution of genetic variation in the species. We partitioned estimates of genetic variance for allozyme, metric, and taxane traits into region, population, family, and within family components in seedling common-garden tests. Genetic diversity, genetic distance, and Nei's G(st) values were estimated based on gene frequencies for 22 isozyme loci. Concentrations of taxanes were determined for needles and roots using HPLC. Populations of Pacific yew are more distinct from one another than is typical of long-lived, wind-pollinated conifers in western North America, but there is little regional differentiation. Yew populations have notably less allozyme diversity than most other gymnosperms with similar life-history characteristics. Most genetic variation in all traits occurs within the population, and much of that is within family. Heritabilities for growth and taxane traits ranged from low to moderately high. Gene conservation or management strategies should include broad sampling among and within populations of Pacific yew. Opportunities for genetic selection to develop improved lines or cultivars for the production of paclitaxel exist, but use of currently domesticated yew species is more time and cost efficient.

AB Geographic variation in growth rates of the eastern fence lizard, Sceloporus undulatus, is extensive and has been interpreted in various ways. For example, slow growth rates of lizards in eastern woodland populations might reflect phenotypic plasticity induced by low food availability, unfavorable thermal environments, or a combination of both. By supplementally feeding free-ranging lizards from the New Jersey Pine Barrens, I tested the hypothesis that food directly limits growth rate. I also reared juveniles from New Jersey and from the Savannah River Site in South Carolina in a laboratory ''common garden'' to test whether higher growth rates could be induced by ad libitum food, water, and unconstrained access to thermoregulatory sites, and whether there were population specific differences in responses to the common laboratory environment. Supplemental feeding had no significant effect on growth rates of free-ranging lizards relative to unsupplemented control lizards, and laboratory growth rates did not significantly exceed field growth rates for lizards in New Jersey or South Carolina. The absence of an increase in growth rates of supplementally fed, free-ranging or laboratory-reared lizards relative to control animals and population-specific allometry between snout-vent length and mass in a common laboratory environment is consistent with adaptive hypotheses that assume differences between populations in growth rate and other life history traits are the result of genetic differences. Implications for interpreting geographic variation in S. undulatus are discussed.

AB Phyllonorycter sp. (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae) preferentially oviposited on leaves of vigorous potted and wild Salix lasiolepis Benth. (Salicaceae) host plants. A given unit of leaf area on a vigorous potted host plant was also more likely to be oviposited on, but this was not true of vigorous wild plants. These patterns of host use increased Phyllonorycter survival by reducing mortality associated with premature abscission of Salix leaves and shoots. An in situ common garden experiment demonstrated that Phyllonorycter densities and performance were not influenced by the clonal identity of potted host plants. Drought treatment of potted plants reduced shoot lengths and xylem water potential, but did not influence Phyllonorycter density.

AB Competitive relationships were estimated for plants from young and old pasture populations. Experimental treatments were conducted under both common garden field station conditions and actual grazed pasture conditions. The results suggest four conclusions. (1) Grazing and other 'pasture' conditions did not prevent plant competition. (2) Interspecific competition appears to promote the use of different resources (niche divergence). (3) Intraspecific competition may lead to a broadening of resource use by a species and, thus, indirectly increase both niche overlap and interspecific competition. No evidence was found to support an alternative theory of co-existence in which interspecific competition is argued to promote a balancing of competitive abilities without changes to relative niche overlap. (4) Changes in resource use appears to occur within a few decades after pasture formation.

AB The annual cycles of breeding and moult were studied in four species of birds in Liberia in tropical West Africa: Fiscal Shrike, Lanius collaris Linnaeus 1758; Vieillot's Black Weaver, Ploceus nigerrrimus Vieillot 1819; Common Garden Bulbul, Pycnonotus barbatus (Desfontaines 1789); and Little Greenbul, Andropadus virens Cassin 1857. Pronounced differences were observed. The insectivorous L. collaris reproduced during the wet season, with moult towards the end of the wet season. This species experienced significant weight loss during the dry season, when food was more scarce. In contrast, the omnivorous P. nigerrimus fed on rice during the dry season, with rapid moult and continuation of breeding during this time. Only male P. nigerrimus experienced significant weight loss during the dry season, possibly because of large energy expenditures associated with nest building. The omnivorous P. barbatus appeared to be non-seasonal in reproduction, with moult in the wet season. The omnivorous A. virens was non-seasonal in both breeding and moult. Thus, there were four different patterns of reproduction and moult among the four species: wet-season breeding/wet-season moult, L. collaris; non-seasonal breeding/dry-season moult, P. nigerrimus; non-seasonal breeding/wet-season moult, P. barbatus; and non-seasonal breeding/non-seasonal moult, A. virens.

AB A common-garden study of Populus trichocarpa Torr. & Gray was initiated in 1985, when clonal material from 128 trees was collected from sites distributed along two mesic (Hoh, Nisqually) and two xeric (Dungeness, Yakima) river valleys. This material was grown for 1 year at Puyallup, Wash. In spring 1986, cuttings from this material were used to establish two replicate plantations, one at Puyallup and the other at Wenatchee, Wash. Data were collected from a subset of 80 clones on 8 single-leaf and 14 crown traits after two growing seasons. Analyses of variance revealed significant (p less than or equal to 0.10) differences among rivers in nearly all single-leaf traits by the second year at both plantations. Two-year leaf sizes at Puyallup significantly declined in this order: Hoh (388 cm(2)) > Nisqually > Dungeness > Yakima (194 cm(2)). At Wenatchee, a similar mesic > xeric pattern was found among river sources, but leaves were smaller there. When grown at Puyallup, leaves of clones from lower elevations in the Yakima valley were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.10) smaller, lighter, thinner, and weighed less per unit area than upper elevation clones. Chi-square tests showed that abaxial leaf surfaces were greener in Yakima trees than in trees from other locations, especially in those from the the lower Yakima valley. In the crown traits of trees grown in Puyallup, river and clone-within-site-within-river effects were significant for all traits, whereas site-within-river effects were significant for only 8 traits. Mesic-origin trees were significantly larger in size traits, e.g., branch length, than xeric-origin trees. Trees from the Yakima drainage system were leafier and branchier (p less than or equal to 0.10) than both Nisqually and Hoh trees. Values for most crown traits were greater (p less than or equal to 0.10) in the xeric, lower Yakima clones than in the mesic, upper Yakima clones. These mesic-xeric differences were similar for Dungeness trees, although there were few significant differences between the lower and upper elevational groups. Single-leaf and crown traits of trees from the four river valleys seem to be adapted to the respective mesic and xeric conditions of the source environments. Within the Yakima river valley, a sharp change in leaf and crown traits and in atmospheric moisture levels coincide midway along the transect, suggesting the presence of a steep selection gradient in the Bristol Canyon area.

AB Provenance tests of 143 populations of Larix accidentalis revealed genetic differentiation for eight variables describing growth, phenology, tolerance to spring frosts, effects of Meria laricis needle cast, and survival. Geographic variables accounted for as much as 34% of the variance among Rocky Mountain populations. Patterns of genetic variation were dominated by the effects of latitude and elevation, with populations from the north and from high elevations having the lowest growth potential, the least tolerance to the needle cast, and the lowest survival. However, the slope of the geographic dines was relatively flat. Populations in the same geographic area, for instance, need to be separated by about 500 m in elevation before genetic differentiation can be expected.
   Regression models using geographic predictors were developed to describe variation in ten climatic variables from 192 weather stations that best represented the Rocky Mountain distribution of L. occidentalis. Values of R(2) ranged from 0.43 to 0.92 and were higher for temperature than for precipitation variables.
   Using climatic effects predicted for each provenance to describe genetic variation produced values of R(2) between 0.15 and 0.27 which accounted for nearly as much (68-100%) of the genetic variance as had geographic variables. The analyses suggested that genetic differentiation was controlled primarily by the relative mildness of the climate. Secondary effects of precipitation were implicated for variables measuring the impact of Meria needle cast and survival.

AB The paper uses the rubric of the postmodern to achieve a distancing from the verisimilitudes of programmatic realism in order to better discuss the phenomenon of the transnationalization of policing. In addition, it offers an overview of the legal, organizational, and technological infrastructures that comprise police co-operation in the European Theatre of Operations. It argues that transnationalisation of the police enterprise is ongoing, emergent and, to a great extent, opaque. The apparently fragmented nature of this enterprise comes in spite of the feeling that Europe urgently requires a security blanket. What appears to be emerging is a Patchwork quilt of agencies, stitched together by the efforts of transnational liaison officers. It is common garden folk-devilry that establishes a pattern for that patchwork quilt.

AB Vaccinium macrorarpon Aiton (Ericaceae) cranberry, a dwarf shrub and a typical taxon in temperate pear bogs, has its central distribution in cool temperate regions in eastern North America. Isolated southern marginal populations are distributed along the Appalachian corridor and on the North Carolina coastal plain. A common garden (Blacksburg, Virginia) was utilized to determine whether marginal cranberry clones exhibit greater phenotypic plasticity than central clones. Three central clones from Massachusetts (MA), Wisconsin (WI), and New York (NY) and three marginal clones from North Carolina (NC), Tennessee (TN), and West Virginia (WV) were tested. A suite of phenotypic traits was measured in response to edaphic variation in the common garden. An analysis of reaction norms took the form of an analysis of covariance to test for significant differences among clones and to estimate regression slopes (plasticity) when compared with environmental (nutrient) variation. There was no regional variation in phenotypic plasticity, but there was significant clonal differentiation for 77% of nonintercorrelated traits. However, in most cases the differences were seemingly random, with little biological importance. Hence little differentiation in relation to population origin was observed among clones. Matrix comparisons were performed using a Mantel test to check for pairwise correlations among the following matrices: geographic distances, trait means, plasticity, and molecular variation assessed by random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) profiling. No correspondence was found among matrices. The recent post-glacial distribution of cranberry may account for the absence of phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity.

AB 1. The phytochrome-mediated stem elongation response of many plant species to crowding has been hypothesized to be an example of adaptive plasticity. The photomorphogenic response is cued by the lowered red:far red ratio (R:FR) of light reflected off or transmitted through neighbouring plants. Because stem elongation could potentially be cued in low density stands by the overhead forest canopy, it has been sug gested that plants of the forest understorey should be selected to be less responsive to R:FR or to be responsive only in early spring before canopy closure.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that populations of a herbaceous annual from open and forest habitats differ genetically in their responses to simulated vegetation shade, which like foliage shade absorbs more red light than far red light, lowering the red:far red ratio (R:FR). For three populations of Impatiens capensis from clearing, evergreen woods and deciduous woods sites, we measured the morphogenic responses to simulated vegetation shade in a common garden experiment.
   3. Impatients capensis plants grown in simulated vegetation shade were taller and had more elongated internodes than plants grown in full sun or in neutral shade. Plants from the clearing population were more responsive to simulated vegetation shade than plants from the two wood populations, as predicted. However, the populations did not differ in the timing of their sensitivity to changes in light quality.
   4. The patterns of population differentiation in length and in sensitivity to light quality differed among the hypocotyl, first internode and second internode: in particular, the first internode was significantly more sensitive to light quality in the clearing population compared to the other populations. The differences amongst internodes in patterns of population differentiation suggest relatively independent evolution of internode traits.

AB Populations of bluegill sunfish Lepomis macrochirus, experiencing heavy juvenile predation, showed increased growth rates and increased age and size at maturity relative to populations experiencing decreased predation on juveniles but increased predation on adults. This study examined bluegills experimentally from both types of populations and a cross between them in a common environment to determine if variation in growth and age at maturity is generically or environmentally induced. Two factorial experiments, varying strain of bluegills and resource availability, were used to evaluate differences in growth rate. One experiment, varying strain of bluegills, was used to assess differences in age at maturity. Growth was strongly influenced by resource level, but growth rate did not vary among populations. Nearly all bluegills in each population matured at 1 year of age in a common environment. Thus, variation observed in source populations must be mostly attributable to differences in the environment between populations. At least three factors could potentially cause differences in growth and age at maturity: (1) variation in resource availability; (2) variation in demographic structure; and (3) variation in size-specific mortality rates caused by differences in predator abundance between populations. Observed patterns of variation between populations are best explained by effects of differences in predator populations. (C) 1995 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles

AB Clinal variation in life histories can be genetically based, resulting from selection imposed by different environments, or it may be due to the differential expression of phenotypically plastic traits. We examined the dine in voltinism in the egg-diapausing cricket Allonemobius socius, with populations spanning the switch from a univoltine to a bivoltine phenology. A common garden experiment was employed, using environments that mimicked photoperiod and temperature conditions found in the field. There were only small differences in development time among populations, and the difference in phenology observed in the field is likely due to clinal variation in the length of the growing season. We found large genetically-based differences in the reaction norm for egg diapause that were further magnified by environmental cues. The synergism of genetic and environmental effects was an example of cogradient selection. In the zone of transition between phenologies, voltinism appeared to be a conditional strategy, rather than a genetic polymorphism. First-generation females from this area can lay either direct-developing or diapause eggs depending on the likelihood that a second generation will have sufficient time to develop. For this species, the dine in voltinism is the result of a combination of environmental effects on development, and genetic and environmental influences on egg diapause propensity.

AB In aquatic environments diffusivity is low and CO2 availability can limit plant growth. The hypothesis that natural selection has favored morphological features that reduce resistance to diffusion of CO2 was tested using three phylogenetically independent species pairs from the genus Sphagnum (S. macrophyllum and S. strictum; S. portoricense and S. papillosum; and S. trinitense and S. recurvum). The aquatic (former) and the nonaquatic (latter) species were grown submerged and emerged in a common garden and used for studies of form and function. Aquatic taxa all had similar morphological features that included larger, thinner branch leaves arranged at lower densities and photosynthetic cells more greatly exposed at the leaf surface. The relationship between observed branch and leaf morphology and boundary layer resistance in the S. trinitense-S. recurvum species pair was assessed by measuring diffusion and convection of ions onto nickel-plated models in a variable-speed electrochemical fluid tunnel. For all flow speeds and orientations, the aquatic S. trinitense model had thinner boundary layers than the nonaquatic S. recurvum model. Analysis of stable isotopes of carbon from the growth experiment corroborated results from the fluid-tunnel experiments. The aquatic taxa all had lower delta C-13 values when grown submerged compared to their nonaquatic pair with the exception of the nonaquatic S. strictum, which was removed due to low growth rates. These results indicate that aquatic species did experience lower overall resistance to CO2 uptake than nonaquatic taxa. Our observations suggest that aquatic habitats do select for morphological features that lower resistance to gas exchange.

AB Females of many insects possess an ovipositor, which in crickets is usually used to place eggs deep into the soil. Ovipositor length in female striped ground crickets (Allonemobius socius) increased at higher latitudes and altitudes in North America, despite an opposing trend in overall body size. Crickets inhabiting regions with short growing seasons and long, cold winters invariably had longer ovipositors than crickets inhabiting warmer regions. The only exception to this observation was for first generation crickets in bivoltine populations where there was no pattern of geographic variation in ovipositor length. However, second generation females from these same populations always had longer ovipositors than their first generation ancestors, and followed a pattern of geographic variation similar to that found for univoltine crickets. Overall, these results support Masaki's (1986) model, which predicts that longer ovipositors will evolve in northern cricket populations as an evolutionary response to the selective advantages of overwintering eggs being oviposited deep in the soil in cold habitats.
   In order to determine the mechanisms underlying patterns of phenotypic variation in the wild, and to test the hypothesis that interpopulation variation reflects genetic differentiation while intergeneration variation within a population reflects environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity, crickets from eight populations were brought to the laboratory and reared through three generations in a common garden. It was found that laboratory-reared populations varied significantly in ovipositor length, with the pattern of variation mimicking that found for field-collected crickets. This finding supports the hypothesis that geographic variation in the wild has a significant genetic basis. The influence of environment on ovipositor length was examined in 20 full-sib families from a bivoltine population. Crickets reared in ''autumn-like'' conditions (30 degrees C, 15:9 h, L:D), such as might be experienced by second generation bivoltine crickets in the wild, were generally larger and had significantly longer ovipositors than siblings reared under ''spring-like'' conditions (27 degrees C, 11:13 h, L:D). This pattern corresponds to that observed for bivoltine populations in the wild and suggests the importance of environmental cues for phenotypic plasticity, or polyphenism in ovipositor length in bivoltine populations of this cricket.

AB Genecological evidence and evidence obtained from an isozyme survey suggest a considerable amount of intraspecific differentiation in Senecio vernalis. Plants of this species from Israel were found to differ strikingly from those of C European (German) origin in most of the traits investigated, e.g., in the possession of pronounced seed dormancy, which seems to be governed by a single gene, a shorter life cycle, lack of rosette growth correlated with stem elongation prior to budding, a larger number of smaller capitula with fewer (disc) florets, and an ephemeral habit with plants only flowering soon after the first winter rains. Both accessions achieved a similar reproductive potential by different means.
   Electrophoretic analysis of eleven isozyme loci using seven different enzyme systems demonstrated that S. vernalis from Israel and C Europe fit the general pattern that has emerged from plant isozyme studies involving presumed source populations and colonizers derived from these. Thus, the allelic diversity of C European S. vernalis represented a subset of the variation present in S. vernalis from Israel. Historical and ecological factors, interspecific hybridization, and the phylogenetic relationship between the two accessions are discussed as possible causes of the variation in isozyme patterns observed.
   It is evident that the study of exclusively C European material of S. vernalis by previous workers has concealed phenotypic similarities between Israeli S. vernalis and the closely related S. vulgaris var. vulgaris in speed of development, and probably also photoperiodic response, and several vegetative traits. The presence of pronounced seed dormancy and a strongly abbreviated life cycle in Mediterranean material of both S. vernalis and S. vulgaris var. vulgaris are considered major adaptations to environmental conditions imposed by the Mediterranean climate, leading to similarities in habit.
   The phylogenetic implications of the present observation of both isozyme and phenotypic variability are briefly discussed.

AB Tropical forest biomes are characterized by a high biodiversity. However, this biological complexity is diminishing rapidly. The causes for the decline and deterioration of tropical forests in Zaire were analysed. The main factors causing loss of biodiversity are shifting agriculture, fuelwood consumption, and fires in open forests and savannas. Measures for maintenance of forest biodiversity are proposed. These include in situ and ex situ conservation, suitable agricultural and silvicultural management systems, based on knowledge of genetic structure, genecology, reproductive biology of tropical plant populations, and biotic and edaphoclimatic factors. The active participation and support of the Zairean people as a whole, and policy and institutional reform are essential for a more effective utilization, management, and protection of the forests, so that socio-economic and environmental benefits are provided for present and future generations. Sustainable forestry development requires also a greater collaboration between government agencies and local communities and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

AB The ecological basis for breeding-system evolution was explored in Ecballium elaterium (L.) A. Rich. (Cucurbitaceae). Two subspecies are parapatric on the Iberian Peninsula: dioicum (dioecious) is found in southern, more arid regions and elaterium (monoecious) is found in northern, wetter regions. Six experimental gardens were set up in three sites that span the climatic gradient of the species' natural range in Spain in order to address two issues: (1) gender specialization in reproductive characters and life history, and (2) ecological specialization of the two subspecies across environments.
   Overall, the dioecious subspecies outperformed the monoecious subspecies. Monoecious plants, on average, were shorter-lived in all environments. Females of the dioecious subspecies produced similar numbers of female flowers, but more fruits and seeds, than did monoecious plants (cosexuals). The fruits of females contained more, but smaller, seeds than the fruits of cosexuals. Males always produced more male flowers than did cosexuals, disproportionately so with increased plant size (canopy volume); no such disproportionate increase in seed production was found in females.
   A geographic analysis of gender (proportion of female flowers) in the monoecious plants revealed a striking pattern: dimorphism with increased gender differentiation in drier sites, in contrast to monomorphism with respect to gender in wetter sites.
   Differences between the subspecies and between habitat types can be related directly to breeding-system differences. The higher overall performance of dioecious plants may be due to enhanced heterozygosity resulting from outcrossing enforced by dioecy. On the other hand, the gender differentiation of the monoecious plants in the drier sites may reflect gender allocation ''decisions'' enforced by limited resource availability.

AB 1. Seedlings representing 25 populations of Pseudotsuga menziesii and 26 populations of Pinus ponderosa were grown in a common garden in Moscow, ID, USA. The seeds were collected across the natural distribution of each species, at altitudes ranging from 170 to 2774 m above sea level, latitudes from 33 degrees N to 53 degrees N, and longitudes from 105 degrees W to 124 degrees W. Lipid-free seeds from mother trees and leaf tissue from the 2-year-old progeny were analysed. The design enabled us not only to measure genetically determined variation in carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) and gas exchange characteristics but also to compare performance in the common garden and in situ.
   2. In the common garden, significant population variation in Delta, gas exchange and specific leaf area was detected among seedlings of Pseudotsuga menziesii. Coastal, low-altitude genotypes had significantly lower Delta than interior, high-altitude genotypes. In Pinus ponderosa, populations varied only in specific leaf area. These broadly distributed sympatric species differ in genetic structure with respect to gas-exchange characteristics.
   3. In the common garden, high Delta of both species was associated with high stomatal conductance relative to photosynthetic rate. Specific leaf area, although strongly correlated with Delta, varied in the wrong direction to explain variation in Delta.
   4. In situ Delta was correlated with both altitude and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in Pseudotsuga menziesii (r(2)=0.42, P=0.002 and r(2)=0.25, P<0.02 for altitude and VPD, respectively), but not in Pinus ponderosa (r(2)=0.004, P>0.77 and r(2)=0.06, P>0.21 for altitude and VPD, respectively).
   5. Foliage Delta from the progeny grown in the common garden was significantly correlated, in both species, with Delta of the in situ maternal photosynthate in the seeds; however, the correlation was negative in Pseudotsuga menziesii and positive in Pinus ponderosa. The negative correlation indicates a strong acclimatory response, perhaps to VPD, in Pseudotsuga menziesii.
   6. Altitudinal decreases in intercellular CO2 partial pressures inferred from isotopic data were insufficient to compensate for increased VPD. Photosynthetic water-use efficiency (net photosynthesis/transpiration) was estimated to decrease by two- to fourfold from sea level to 2800 m altitude within the distribution limits of these species.

AB A Strategy for the Conservation of Genetic Resources of Trees and Shrubs in Denmark was prepared in 1991/93. The objective of the strategy is to secure the ability of the species covered to adapt to environmental changes, and to maintain the basis for future improvement work. The strategy includes 75 tree and shrub species of actual or potential use for planting in Denmark. Unless protective measures are taken, the size and constitution of the genetic variation of these species will, as a result of present human influence, most likely be affected in the medium-to-long term in a way that may reduce their adaptability and utility significantly.
   The article focuses on the systematic approach to gene resource conservation taken in Denmark. This approach provides an overview of the conservation effort required, estimated as a number of conservation stands with a minimum size and a specified geographical distribution for each species. A review of human influence on the forest genetic resources since early forest development provides the relevant background. Emphasis is given to prevailing silvicultural practices.
   The genetic resources in Denmark will, in general, be conserved in evolutionary conservation stands, in situ or ex situ. For most species a network of conservation stands is required to cover the spectrum of assumed genecological variability. A preliminary genecological zonation, the biology and the distribution of each species have served to estimate the required number and distribution of conservation stands. From 2 to 15 conservation stands are considered adequate for the different species. The estimated number of conservation stands to conserve the genetic variation of the 75 species is approximately 600. Around 500 will be in situ and around 100 ex situ. The total area required is approximately 1800 ha (excluding isolation zones) or 0.4% of the total forest area and 5% of the natural forest area in Denmark. The size of the area corresponds approximately to the area of certified seed stands/seed production areas in Denmark.
   The conservation of genetic resources is not pursued by imposing restrictions on the use of the genetic material. The philosophy of the strategy is to effect an insurance and keep all options open. The wise use of the genetic resources will be encouraged by other means. Where target species can be identified and (gene) ecological zones defined, the approach described may be used elsewhere to provide a quick and realistic overview of conservation needs and costs.

AB We evaluated winter (January through March) carbon assimilation of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.) from three Vermont seed sources grown in a common garden in northwestern Vermont. Although CO2 exchange rates were generally low, net photosynthetic rates increased during two prolonged thaws. Significant correlations between CO2 exchange rates and multiday air temperature means supported our observations of enhanced gas exchange during extended periods of elevated temperature. Increases in photosynthesis during thaws occurred before observed increases in leaf conductance, indicating that initial changes in photosynthesis were probably not associated with changes in stomatal aperture. Results of correlations between photosynthetic rates and PAR suggested that solar irradiance did not have a strong effect on winter carbon capture.
   Rates of net photosynthesis differed among seed sources. Trees from the Mt. Mansfield source had the highest average rates of photosynthesis and, at times, rates for individual trees from this source approximated those occurring during the growing season. Because seed sources differed in photosynthetic rates but not in leaf conductance, we conclude that differences in winter photosynthesis among seed sources were primarily attributable to factors other than changes in stomatal aperture.

AB We observed the number of predatory mites (phytoseiidae: Typhlodromus caudiglans) on the foliage of 20 North American species of grapes (Vitis spp) plus the domesticated European Vitis vinifera, all grown in a common garden. We found relatively few phytophagous mites. The numbers of phytophagous mites were not correlated with the plant characteristics that we measured. We found approximately five times as many predatory mites as phytophagous mites and the numbers of these phytoseiid predators were not affected by the availability of prey. Similarly, numbers of phytoseiids were unaffected by plant gender and, hence, the availability of pollen, another source of food. The numbers of phytoseiids were not clustered according to the taxonomic grouping of the tested plant species. Leaf surface characteristics explained over 25% of the variance in the numbers of phytoseiids. Numbers of phytoseiids were positively associated with the density of vein hairs, the density of bristles in leaf axils, and the presence of leaf domatia. These results suggest that sheltered habitats rather than food availability may limit the numbers of phytoseiid mites on grapevines.

AB We grew loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws.) seedlings in a factorial experiment with two CO2 partial pressures (35 and 70 Pa) and two nitrogen treatments (1.0 and 3.5 mM NH4+) for one growing season in a 'common garden' experiment designed to examine the extent that dry matter and nitrogen accumulation and partitioning are environmentally controlled. Ponderosa pine seedlings grown in 35 Pa CO2 and 3.5 mM NH4+ showed symptoms of nitrogen toxicity, characterized by greatly reduced growth, and moderately reduced total plant N. With the exception of this treatment combination, there were no significant differences between species in total plant dry matter or total plant nitrogen, suggesting that responses of growth to environmental conditions were stronger than heritable responses. There were however large differences in dry matter and N partitioning between the two species. Increases in leaf mass were largest in loblolly pine, whilst ponderosa pine tended to have higher root:shoot (R:S) ratios. R:S ratio of loblolly increased in response to C availability and decreased in response to N availability, whilst R: S ratio of ponderosa pine was much less responsive to resource availability. Total plant N varied with N supply, and N partitioning was related to plant growth and carbon partitioning. Carbon and N were interactive, such that an increase in the accumulation of either resource was always accompanied by an increase in the other. Over several seasons the different patterns of resource acquisition and biomass allocation that we observed in a uniform environment could potentially result in different growth rates at most resource levels. In the first season, contrary to our expectations, heritable differences in growth rate did not appear.

LA English
DT Article
AB TO determine whether Helenium virginicum is distinct from H. autumnale, we compared morphological and ecological characters of more than 450 seed-grown plants from six populations of H. virginicum and nine populations of H. autumnale in common and transplant gardens. Populations compared were selected after we surveyed more than 1,000 herbarium sheets from eight herbaria in search of populations of H. autumnale most similar to H. virginicum, as well as populations representing the range of morphological variation of H. autumnale in the eastern U.S. Six narrow-leaved H. autumnale populations from New Jersey, Missouri, and Ontario, Canada, were chosen because of similarity to H. virginicum, while three populations of H. autumnale from Vermont and Virginia represented the broad-leaved form. Transplant gardens were H. autumnale habitats and H. virginicum habitats. We found H. virginicum to be distinct from both New Jersey narrow-leaved and broad-leaved H. autumnale in 14 of 15 morphological characters as well as in survival in transplant gardens. Twelve of 15 morphological characters, plus survival in transplant gardens, distinguished H. virginicum from Canadian narrow-leaved H. autumnale. Future genetic and evolutionary studies are needed to clarify the relationship between H. virginicum and the Missouri population, which differed from H. virginicum in only three of 15 morphological characters and survived better in H. virginicum habitats than in H. autumnale habitats. Common-garden grown hybrids between H. virginicum and H. autumnale were easily recognizable by morphology and had reduced pollen fertility. Similar hybrids have not been observed in the held.

AB Regulation of seed germination timing is an important component of population persistence, especially for short-lived plants in seasonal environments with unpredictable year-to-year weather variation. Seed germination patterns were examined in the laboratory for seeds from 135 populations belonging to 38 species and 13 sections of the genus Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae), from habitats ranging from warm desert to alpine tundra. Seeds of most species were dormant at dispersal and required a period of moist chilling to become germinable. Response to chilling was related to probable chilling duration at the collection site. Populations from habitats with severe winters produced seeds with long chilling requirements, while those from habitats with mild winters produced seeds with short chilling requirements. Populations from midelevation habitats produced seeds with intermediate chilling requirements but with a sizeable fraction whose dormancy was not broken by chilling of any length. Another pattern observed mostly in warm desert populations was little primary dormancy at autumn temperatures combined with induction of a fraction into secondary dormancy by short chilling. Species with a wide habitat range included populations with contrasting germination patterns. Parallel habitat-correlated patterns were observed in different sections. Most species showed germination patterns that combined predictive mechanisms with potential for carryover of a persistent seed bank. Results of common garden experiments suggested that germination differences had a strong genetic basis both among populations and among plants in a population. Adaptive radiation in the genus Penstemon has thus included the evolution of habitat-specific germination timing strategies in multiple lineages within the genus.

AB The hypothesis that aquatic plants have greater allocation to photosynthetic tissues was tested using a common garden experiment with three pairs of ecologically contrasting Sphagnum species (S. portoricense and S. papillosum; S. trinitense and S. recurvum; S. macrophyllum var. floridanum and S. strictum). When submerged, aquatic taxa (the former in each pair) all had greater relative growth rates and greater allocation to photosynthetic tissues, as evidenced by higher whole plant chlorophyll content. The evolution of greater photosynthetic allocation appears to result from changes in two independently evolving systems: allocation to photosynthetic cells rather than nonphotosynthetic hyaline cells, and a shift in biochemical partitioning within photosynthetic cells favoring light-reaction proteins. The former was assessed by comparing photosynthetic cell volume in leaves, and the latter was estimated from chlorophyll to nitrogen ratios. The mechanism whereby greater photosynthetic allocation was achieved differed in each aquatic species. In a second experiment, variation in growth and allocation was assessed for three populations each of S. trinitense and S. recurvum. Nested analysis of variance verified that the differences between S. trinitense and S. recurvum observed in relative growth rate and chlorophyll content in the species-level test were robust given the magnitude of population-level variation. It is concluded that (i) aquatic habitats do select for features that lead to greater relative growth rate in submerged environments, (ii) relative growth rate is functionally correlated with allocation to photosynthetic tissues, (iii) allocations at the cellular and biochemical level evolve independently, and (iv) patterns of allocation represent adaptations to environmental conditions present in the aquatic environment.

AB There is much spatial and temporal variation for reproductive output in white clover (Trifolium repens L.), yet little is known about the control of this variation or whether there exist tradeoffs among components of seed yield. To examine these issues, seed yield components and vegetative biomass were measured on replicates of seven white clover genotypes planted in a common garden plot. Significant genetic differences among clones were found for biomass and for five of seven reproductive characters, including number of inflorescences, number of florets per inflorescence, number of fruits per infructescence, number of (late-maturing) seed per fruit, and seed weight in early-maturing fruits. Thus, there is considerable potential for natural or artificial selection to act on vegetative and reproductive characters in white clover. In addition to these genetic effects, we observed temporal variation for number of florets per inflorescence, number of fruits per infructescence, and seed weight in late-maturing fruits. Finally, analyses of phenotypic, genetic, and microenvironmental correlation coefficients revealed few pairs of traits with significant negative correlations. This suggests that few tradeoffs in resource allocation patterns existed for the phenotypic characters examined.

AB Despite a large body of theory, few studies have directly assessed the effects of variation in population size on fitness components in natural populations of plants We conducted studies on 10 populations of scarlet gilia, Ipomopsis aggregata, to assess the effects of population size and year-to-year variation in size on the relative fitness of plants. We showed that seed size and germination success ave significantly reduced in small populations (those less than or equal to 100 flowering plants) of scarlet gilia Plants from small populations are also more susceptible to environmental stress. When plants from small and large populations were subjected to an imposed stress (combined effects of transplanting and experimental clipping, simulating ungulate herbivory) in a common garden experiment plants from small populations suffered higher mortality and were ultimately of smaller size than plants from large populations. In addition experimental evidence indicates that observed fitness reductions are genetic, arte to the effects of genetic drift and/or inbreeding depression When pollen was introduced from distant populations into two small populations, seed mass and percentage of germination were bolstered while pollen transferred into a large population had no significant effect. Year-to-year variation in population size and its effects on plant fitness are also discussed In one small population, for example, a substantial increase in size from within did not introduce sufficient new (archived) genetic material to fully overcome the effects of inbreeding depression.

AB 1. The Tritrophic and Enemy Impact concepts predict that natural enemy impact varies: (a) among plant genotypes and (b) may depend on the abundance of heterospecific herbivores, respectively. I tested these predictions using three herbivore species on potted, cloned genotypes of Salix sericea Marshall in a common garden experiment.
   2. Densities of the leaf miner (Phyllonorycter salicifoliella (Chambers)) and two leaf galling sawflies (Phyllocolpa nigrita (Marlatt) and Phyllocolpa eleanorae Smith and Fritz) varied significantly among willow clones, indicating genetic variation in resistance.
   3. Survival and natural enemy impact caused by egg and larval parasitoids and/or unknown predators differed significantly among willow clones for each of the three herbivore species, indicating genetic variation in survival and enemy impact.
   4. Survival of Phyllonorycter was negatively density-dependent among clones.
   5. Survival of Phyllonorycter and Phyllocolpa eleanorae were positively correlated with densities of heterospecific herbivores among clones and parasitism of these species were negatively correlated with densities of the same heterospecific herbivores among clones.
   6. At least for Phyllonorycter this positive correlation may suggest either facilitation of survival between herbivore species, which do not share natural enemies, or an apparent interaction caused by host plant genetic variation.
   7. Among clones, egg parasitism of Phyllocolpa eleanorne was weakly positively correlated with density of Phyllocolpa nigrita. Since these species share the same Trichogramma egg parasitoid, this interaction could support the hypothesis of apparent competition.

AB 1. Results from a common garden experiment and from a survey of isozymic variation, using population samples of Bromus sterilis, collected from five pairs of field-boundary and mid-field habitats, provided no evidence of habitat-correlated differentiation of the populations in response to the differences in selective pressure between cropped and boundary habitats.
   2. Pairs of populations from the same field could not be differentiated either by quantitative characteristics or by allele frequencies, though populations from different fields could be distinguished.
   3. Results from a more intensive survey of isozymic variation, in a population occurring along a hedge-field interface, provided further evidence of the close genetic relationship between hedge and field populations. A strong association in allele frequencies was detected between samples from adjacent sections of hedge and field but not between samples from more distant sections.
   4. It is suggested that boundary populations act as a major seed source for continual re-infestation of the field, and that the unstable nature of ephemeral field infestations prevents ecotypic differentiation.

AB Previous work in New Zealand has shewn that genetic variation within populations of Agrostis capillaris can be comparable to that between populations, even between populations over a very wide environmental range. To determine whether this reflects the recent advent of A. capillaris in New Zealand, with a small founding gene pool and a short time for ecotypic differentiation, populations from a comparable range of environments were sampled randomly in the same way in Britain. Populations were grown in comparable conditions in the two countries, but to ensure comparability only proportional variation was examined. Characters used in the assessment of within- and between-population variation were step+sheath length, lamina length, lamina width and relative growth rate.
   Within populations, there were highly significant genotypic differences, especially in the British populations. Differences between populations were rather greater than those within-populations, and for lamina length this was significant in both countries.
   For both Britain and New Zealand, there were cases where the two genotypes sampled from a population were similar in a particular character. In some cases, populations from comparable habitats in the two countries were similar to each other.
   For the three morphological characters, total genotypic variation over all populations sampled was greater in Britain than in New Zealand. For some characters this was due to between-site variation, and for some to within-site variation.
   It is concluded that some of the evidence for non-adaptation in A. capillaris in New Zealand is caused by a more limited gene pool, and insufficient time for sorting of genotypes into habitats.

AB The phenotypic expression of quantitative characters is a function of the individual's genotype and the environment in which it is measured. In a previous reciprocal transplant study, we found that patterns of genetic differences in resistance to herbivores among adjacent subpopulations of northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), were consistent with a local adaptation hypothesis. The goal of this study was to determine if variation in water availability may have been a mechanism responsible for these previously observed patterns. In 1989 a common garden study was initiated using acorns from maternal trees occupying either a north- or south-facing slope microhabitat in an oak-hickory forest in east central Missouri, USA. The seedlings were grown under one of two water treatments, irrigated or natural. In 1992, we utilized this experiment to examine the quantitative character of the percentage of leaf area damaged by herbivores, which is a measure of the phenotypically expressed level of resistance. Specifically, we made three predictions: (1) because northern red oak seem to grow best in mesic environments, seedlings receiving more water should show greater resistance to herbivores; (2) if the subpopulations from north- and south-facing slope microhabitats are genetically differentiated with respect to the quantitative character of resistance to herbivores, then there will be a significant effect of maternal slope microhabitat on the percentage of leaf area damaged; and (3) if the pattern of resistance to herbivores found among subpopulations reflects local adaptation to moisture levels in their own microhabitat, then we would expect to find a significant maternal slope microhabitat by water treatment interaction, with north-facing slope seedlings incurring less damage in the wetter (irrigated) treatment and south-facing slope seedlings incurring less damage in the drier (natural) treatment. Our data supported the first two predictions: seedlings in the irrigated treatment showed a significantly lower percentage of leaf area damage than those in the natural treatment, and the percentage of leaf area damaged was significantly lower on seedlings from maternal plants occupying the north-facing slope microhabitat. However, we found no significant interaction between maternal slope microhabitat and water treatment. These findings demonstrate that northern red oak subpopulations respond phenotypically to water availability, but this factor does not appear to be the underlying mechanism behind the previously observed local adaptation expressed as resistance to herbivores.

AB We examined the genetic variation of ecophysiological traits within and among 40 red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) provenances (two families per provenance) in a common-garden experiment in the summer of 1993. The provenances were representative of the entire species range in British Columbia, Canada. We found significant genetic variation among provenances (P < 0.001) in photosynthetic rate (A), mesophyll conductance (g(m)), transpiration rate (E), stomatal conductance (g(sw)), stomatal sensitivity to water vapour pressure deficit (SENS(VPD)), intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration ratio (C-i/C-a), and midday xylem water potential (psi). Photosynthetic water-use efficiency, however, did not differ significantly among provenances. There were no significant differences between families within provenance for any of these variables. A weak but significant geographic trend was detected in ecophysiological traits: psi, A, g(m), and E increased, and SENS(VPD) decreased, from southeast to northwest. Photosynthetic rate, E, g(m), g(sw) and psi were positively related to each other, but negatively correlated with SENS(VPD). C-i/C-a, was negatively correlated with g(sw). These correlations indicate that red alder might have undergone genetic differentiation in drought resistance.

AB We conducted a ''common garden'' experiment to compare aspects of exercise physiology and voluntary wheel-running behavior in wild and random-bred (i.e., non-inbred) laboratory house mice and their reciprocal crosses. Analysis of covariance indicated that, after effects of body mass and other appropriate covariates (e.g., age at testing) were accounted for, wild (range 2.46-3.30 m/s, n = 12) and hybrid (range 1.69-3.30 m/s, n = 24) mice exhibited forced maximal sprint running speeds that averaged similar to 50% higher than those of random-bred laboratory mice (range 1.11-2.12 m/s, n = 19). Wild and hybrid mice also had significantly higher (+ 22%) mass-corrected maximal rates of oxygen consumption (VO2max) during forced exercise and greater (+ 12%) relative ventricle masses than lab mice. Wild and hybrid mice also showed statistically higher swimming endurance times relative to body mass than lab mice, although these differences were insignificant when body mass was not used as a covariate. No significant differences were found for relative gastrocnemius muscle mass, liver mass, hematocrit, or blood hemoglobin content. During a 7-day test on voluntary activity wheels, both wild and hybrid mice ran significantly more total revolutions (+ 101%), ran at higher average velocities when they were active (+ 69%), and exhibited higher maximum revolutions in any single 1-min period (+ 41% on the 7th day of testing), but the total number of active 1-min intervals did not differ significantly among groups. In general, the behavioral and/or whole organism performance traits showed greater differences than the lower-level traits; thus, during the domestication of house mice, behavior may have evolved more rapidly than physiology.

TI HABITAT-CORRELATED VARIATION IN SEED-GERMINATION RESPONSE TO CHILLING IN
   PENSTEMON SECTION GLABRI (SCROPHULARIACEAE)
SO AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST
LA English
DT Article
ID TEMPERATURE; DORMANCY; PALMERI
AB Members of Penstemon Section Glabri are common perennial herbs in habitats from desert shrublands to subalpine meadows throughout the Intermountain West.  Germination response to moist chilling was evaluated for 36 populations belonging to 13 species within the section.  Eleven species (P. cyananthus, P. cyaneus, P. cyanocaulis, P. fremontii, P. laevis, P. leiophyllus, P. perpulcher, P. scariosus, P. speciosus, P. strictus and P. subglaber) had seeds that were largely dormant at harvest and responded positively to chilling, whereas two (P. ammophilus and P. commarhenus) had seeds that were largely nondormant.  The proportion of seeds that could be rendered nondormant through chilling varied among species, populations and years of collection; many middle elevation collections contained a large fraction nonresponsive to chill.  Most chill-responsive seeds germinated during prolonged chilling.  Across species, germination rate during chilling was significantly correlated with mean January temperature at the collection site for each of 3 yr of collection, i.e., collections from habitats with warmer winters germinated more quickly in the cold than those from sites with colder winters.  Similarly, the chilling period needed for maximal postchilling germination increased as collection site winter temperature decreased.  Experiments with common garden-grown seeds of six of the species showed that patterns characteristic of wild-collected seeds persisted in the garden, indicating a probable genetic basis for the differences.  Adaptive radiation in Penstemon Section Glabri has resulted in evolution of population-level germination syndromes that maximize the probability of establishment in a range of specific habitats.

AB Lead sequestration in shell was examined for English and Welsh populations of the common garden snail (Helix aspersa) with different Pb exposure histories. Isotopic Pb ratios provided signatures for Pb source and a means of implying duration of population exposure from decades to millennia. Total Pb concentrations were used to quantify the intensity of exposure experienced by the populations. Snails from populations with long histories of exposure (millennia) to high Pb levels had proportionately more Pb in their shell than soft tissue compared with snails from other surveyed populations. These observations suggest that Pb sequestration in shell has been enhanced in H. aspersa populations with long and intense exposure to Pb.

AB We studied geographical variation in the vernalization requirement among European populations of the facultative biennial thistle Cirsium vulgare. In two common garden experiments and a growth room experiment we found genotypes that flowered without cold, in their first year. These annual types originated mainly from the south of Europe. Most of the plants from the northern populations flowered in their second year, after experiencing winter cold. We discuss the effects of the absence of a vernalization requirement on the phenotype.

AB A common-garden study of Populus trichocarpa Torr. and Gray was initiated in 1985 when clonal material from 128 trees was collected from sites distributed along two mesic (Hoh and Nisqually) and two xeric (Dungeness and Yakima) river valleys. This material was grown for 1 year at Puyallup, Wash. In spring 1986, cuttings from this material were used to establish two replicate plantations, one at Puyallup and one at Wenatchee, Wash. Over the 2 year period, trees were assessed for survival, damage, and growth. Two-year survival was 86% at Puyallup and 59% at Wenatchee; survival was higher for mesic-origin trees at both sites. At Wenatchee, mortality was mainly due to a droughty soil and hot, dry climate in the first year, and damage was due to the tarnished plant bug (Lygus spp.), field voles (Microtus spp.), and grasshoppers (Family Acrididae). At both locations, Melampsora occidentalis Jacks. leaf rust was found mainly on trees originating from Yakima. Mean 2-year height and diameter at Puyallup were 457 cm and 40 mm, respectively; corresponding Values at Wenatchee were 320 cm and 29 mm. At Puyallup, 2-year stem volume (diameter(2) x height) decreased significantly in this order: Nisqually (13 500 cm(3)) = Hoh > Dungeness > Yakima (4700 cm(3)). Within the Nisqually trees, clones from lower, milder climate elevations grew more than those from the upper elevations. The reverse was true for the Yakima trees, presumably because the lower elevation trees are adapted to an arid climate and are very susceptible to Melampsora rust. At Wenatchee, high microsite heterogeneity masked much of the genetic variation. The genetic variance component (among rivers, sites, and clones) for stem volume at Puyallup increased from 27 to 51% over the second year. In analyses of each river valley, genetic components (elevational group and clone) were also high at 27-63%; however, for the Yakima trees, the elevational group variance (40%) was much larger than for the other valleys (0-7%) and suggests a steep selection gradient midway along the river transect.

TI POTENTIAL FOR SELECTION ON PLANTS FOR WATER-USE EFFICIENCY AS ESTIMATED

AB Water-use efficiency is thought to be related to plant performance and natural selection for plants in arid habitats, based on a general expectation that increased water-use efficiency is associated with decreased carbon gain and biomass accumulation. Using leaf carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) to determine integrated water-use efficiency, we estimated genetic variance for, and examined the relationships among Delta, biomass, and gas exchange characters for full-sibling families of the woody shrub, Chrysothamnus nauseosus, grown from seed collected at Tintic, Utah. In both well-watered greenhouse and common garden experiments, and water-limited common garden experiments, there were significant family differences for Delta, biomass, and morphological characters, indicating a potential for genetic change in response to selection. However, estimates of broad-sense heritabilities for Delta were low, indicating that the rate of change in response to selection would be relatively slow. This was consistent with the large amount of phenotypic plasticity observed for Delta as it differed with water treatment and year in the garden experiment. Phenotypically, aboveground biomass and Delta were negatively correlated within the well-watered treatments (i.e., more water-use efficient plants were larger), not correlated within the water-limited treatment, and positively correlated for combined well-watered and water-limited garden treatments, suggesting that variation in both photosynthetic capacity and stomatal limitation contribute to the variation in Delta. In contrast to the phenotypic correlations, genetic correlations for biomass and Delta were consistently negative within each treatment, and selection for higher water-use efficiency through low Delta for C. nauseosus plants in this population would tend to shift populations toward larger plants. For C. nauseosus, increased water-use efficiency is not necessarily associated with decreased carbon gain.

AB The exudate and vacuolar flavonoid profiles of four species (five taxa) of New Zealand Cassinia were established.  The exudate chemistry consists of chalcones, dihydrochalcones and flavanones, several of which lack B-ring oxygenation, and quercetin 3-O- and 7-O-methyl ethers.  Vacuolar flavonoids include galangin, eriodictyol-7-O-methyl ether, and a series of kaempferol and quercetin glycosides.  Several combinations of these compounds occur in the taxa studied.  Limited common garden studies suggest that the flavonoid profiles from the different areas may be fixed.  Differences in distribution of flavonoids could be taken as evidence for recognition of several taxa in contrast to the view that only one variable species exists in New Zealand.

AB We conducted a ''common garden'' experiment to compare aspects of thermoregulation and metabolism in wild and random-bred laboratory, house mice (Mus domesticus) and their reciprocal crosses. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated that, after accounting for effects of body mass and other appropriate covariates (e.g., age), wild (N = 12) and hybrid (N = 25) mice together tended to have higher (+9.7%; P = .0904) maximal nonshivering thermogenesis (max-NST) in response to norepinephrine injection than did lab mice (N = 18). Wild (-17.2%; P = .0941) and hybrid (wild dam: -23.1%; P = .0001; lab dam: -11.2%; P = .0749) mice also tended to have lower basal metabolic rates (BMRs) than did lab mice. As a consequence of these trends, wild and hybrid mice, analyzed together, had significantly higher (+18.2%; P = .0263) regulatory NST (max-NST minus BMR) than did lab mice. Paralleling the differences in regulatory NST, wild and hybrid mice together had significantly more (+21.2% P = .0129) interscapular brown adipose tissue than did lab mice. However, plasma thyroid hormone levels (triiodothyronine [T-3] and thyroxine [T-4]) showed no significant differences among groups, and even for the traits that exhibited significant differences, the overlap of values for individual mice was substantial. Moreover, mean values for max-NST and BMR for all four groups fell well within the range of values reported in the literature for small mammals We therefore concluded that random-bred laboratory mice are not necessarily ''degenerate'' with respect to their metabolic and thermoregulatory capacities. Finally, the two reciprocal cross groups differed in BMR (P = .0314), which thus indicated a maternal influence: wild-dam X lab-sire mice had significantly lower BMRs than did lab-dam X wild-sire mice.

AB Adaptive genetic variation in seed and seedling traits for ponderosa pine from the east slopes of the Cascade Range in Oregon was analyzed by using 307 families from 227 locations. Factor scores from three principal components based on seed and seedling traits were related by multiple regression to latitude, distance from the Cascade crest, elevation, slope, and aspect of the seed source and by classification analysis to seed zone and 300-meter elevation band within zone. A provisional transfer risk equation and tentative new seed zones were delineated to guide seed transfer in artificial regeneration.

TI ADAPTATION TO METAL-CONTAMINATED SOILS IN POPULATIONS OF THE MOSS,
   CERATODON PURPUREUS - VEGETATIVE GROWTH AND REPRODUCTIVE EXPRESSION
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
ID BRYUM-ARGENTEUM; TOLERANCE; EVOLUTION; MORPHOLOGY; POLLUTION
AB Many observations suggest that morphological evolution occurs slowly in bryophytes, and this has been suggested to reflect low genetic diversity within species. Isozyme studies, however, stand in apparent contrast and have shown that bryophytes can contain high levels of genetic variability within and among populations. In light of this conflict, we tested the potential of the moss, Ceratodon purpureus, to undergo adaptive change (i.e., ecotypic differentiation) in response to soils that have been contaminated with high levels of metals for 90 years by measuring gametophytic growth and reproductive expression under experimental conditions. Variation in protonemal growth in sterile culture indicates that plants from one population growing on contaminated soil near a smelter are significantly more tolerant of zinc, cadmium, and lead than plants from uncontaminated sites. Results from a common garden experiment, in which plants were grown on soil from the smelter site, indicate that plants from near the smelter are significantly more tolerant of contaminated soils than plants from uncontaminated sites for vegetative growth. The same experiment suggests that plants from the smelter site are also more tolerant in terms of gametangial production (although we could not test this statistically). Our results demonstrate that C. purpureus has been able to undergo relatively rapid evolution in response to strong selective pressures.

AB As an intact clone (one genotype) of Trifolium repens (white clover) grows through a sward, parts of the stolon decay and fragments (ramets) are transplanted into different microenvironments. This common garden study was done to assess the impact this placement has on further development and growth of the new ramets. Genets of T. repens were sampled from each of four origins: from areas in an old pasture dominated by Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, and Lolium perenne, and from seed. Trifolium from each origin was transplanted into each of three grass beds (Dactylis, Holcus, and Lolium) with three replicates. Cuttings were taken annually for 4 years from all the clovers, transplanted into pots, grown for 10-15 weeks, and a number of morphological characters were measured. There was little indication that individuals of Trifolium grow best in their ''home'' neighborhoods. Most variation in the data was the result of within-genet variation, i.e., phenotypic plasticity, a response assuring survival in environments that vary over time and space. The effects of grass neighbors on Trifolium is mainly expressed as size differences and the effect of origins and genets mainly as differences in shape. The latter is due, in part at least, to different growth rates of parts relative to each other, the former to all growth rates being modified in a similar fashion. Because origins and genets have a longer history than treatments, these results argue for an evolutionary sequence of first size followed by shape differences.

AB The aim of this study was (1) to evaluate the importance of dormant buds for the bud demography of the mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp. tortuosa near the tree line and (2) to study whether sexual reproduction leads to costs for bud production rates. A bud population census was taken in two consecutive years for six branches of each of 90 mountain birch trees. The trees were growing in a common garden and belonged to 10 different progenies originating from different parts of Finnish Lapland. The data were analyzed with matrix population models. The most important transformations of the bud populations were between vegetative short and long shoots. However, if most apparently dead buds are actually latent dormants, they make an even more important contribution to the bud population growth rate than vegetative long and short shoots. Dormant buds may have considerable importance especially after events such as herbivore outbreaks, in which short and long shoots are damaged. Generative long shoots (with male catkins) and short shoots (with female catkins) had approximately the same bud production rate as the corresponding vegetative shoots, i.e., bud populations did not show any major costs due to sexual reproduction. Meristem costs, i.e., a decrease in the number of buds due to sexual reproduction, may be relatively low in mountain birch, because new axillary buds develop and compensate for lost shoot apices. This compensation capacity may be especially well developed under suboptimal conditions, where canopy expansion is limited by the harsh environment rather than by the availability of meristems. The resource cost of reproduction (e.g., in terms of carbon or mineral nutrients) may also be partly compensated especially when flowering intensity is sufficiently low.

AB Histocytochemical methods were used to investigate alkaline phosphatase activity in the digestive gland (hepatopancreas) of the common garden snail Helix aspersa. Histochemical findings and light microscopic observations showed that enzymatic activity was confined mainly to the basal connective tissue that enveloped the adenomeres. Transmission electron microscopy showed that enzymatic activity was localized in the plasma membrane, and showed an intercellular distribution along the lateral surfaces and the basal portions of the cells in different adenomeres. Alkaline phosphatase activity was also found in the plasma membrane of fibrocytes of the basal connective tissue enveloping the adenomeres. Enzymatic activity was seen around the fat droplets of glandular cells. The possible involvement of alkaline phosphatase in processes or remodelling of the basal connective tissue that envelopes the gland is discussed.

TI EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON GERMINATION WITHIN AND BETWEEN DIPLOID AND

AB Diploid (2n=18) and tetraploid (2n=36) cytotypes of Matricaria perforata Merat have separate geographic distributions in Canada. Since seeds are the only means of reproduction, a knowledge of the relationship between temperature and germination is important for an understanding of the potential spread of these two invasive cytotypes in Canada. Germination response patterns of six diploid and four tetraploid populations were compared at constant and alternating temperatures ranging from 0 to 45-degrees-C. Tests were performed on achenes collected from plants grown in a common garden for one generation at the location of one of the tetraploid sources. The general pattern of germination was similar for both cytotypes. The upper and lower limits for germination were 40-degrees-C and 5-degrees-C, respectively. Optimum germination occurred at alternating temperatures of 30/10-degrees-C. No primary dormancy was found. Although the general response pattern was similar and little variation existed among populations, germination did differ at suboptimal constant temperatures; tetraploid populations germinated 28 to 39% more than the diploids within the suboptimal range. These genetic differences may reflect adaptation to prolonged cold winters since the tetraploid populations were collected from more northern latitudes than the diploid populations.

TI LIFE-HISTORY VARIATION IN BLUE FLAX (LINUM PERENNE, LINACEAE) -
   SEED-GERMINATION PHENOLOGY
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English
DT Article
ID HABITAT-CORRELATED VARIATION; DORMANCY
AB Linum perenne L. is a nonclonal perennial herb widely distributed across a range of habitats. Variation in seed germination patterns was examined for 21 Intermountain collections and for the commercial cultivar 'Appar'. Collections from sites with long, snowy winters were largely dormant at harvest and responded positively to chilling. Collections from middle elevation sagebrush-grassland sites were generally nondormant and contained a fraction induced into secondary dormancy by chilling. Collections from palouse prairie and pinyon-juniper sites were generally nondormant and unaffected by chilling, as was 'Appar'. When seeds of contrasting populations were planted in seed retrieval experiments at low, middle, and high elevation sites, their Geld germination phenology was predictable from laboratory experiments. In common garden experiments, there were significant among-sibship differences in germination for each garden-grown wild accession but not for 'Appar', suggesting that differences both among and within populations may be genetically based. Garden-grown seeds were generally less dormant than wild-collected seeds, possibly because of selection during propagation. Results demonstrated the existence of ecologically relevant among-population and within-population variation in germination phenology for blue flax. Seeds of high-montane populations are spring-emerging and have little provision for between-year carryover. Populations from lower elevation habitats with less predictable weather have seeds with contrasting germination patterns, allowing for emergence in both fall and spring as well as for seed bank carryover. 'Appar' seeds lack these predictive and carryover mechanisms.

AB Common garden snails Helix aspersa Muller were subjected to 3 weeks of desiccation at 20 degrees C and 80% rh, during which the water content of the foot declined from an average of 85% in well hydrated individuals, to 80.7% of wet weight. In the same time, hemolymph osmolarity varied from 154 to 219 mOsmol/l, There is a highly significant correlation between these two variables, osmolarity being inversely related to foot water volume, suggesting that extra- and intracellular fluids are in osmotic equilibrium. No active snail had a blood osmolarity higher than 80 mOsmol/l and no quiescent snail bad one lower than 186 mOsmol/l. During progressive dehydration, the heart rate declined to about 63% of the initial rate.

DE DECIDUOUS CONIFER; LARIX; PRODUCTIVITY; WATER-USE EFFICIENCY
AB Photosynthetic gas exchange, stable carbon isotope discrimination (DELTA), height and diameter were compared among five open-pollinated families of 12-year-old western larch trees growing in a common garden in Moscow, Idaho, USA. Statistically significant variation was detected among the families in the two growth traits, DELTA and stomatal conductance.to water vapor (g) (P less-than-or-equal-to 0.013), but differences among families in photosynthetic rate (A) and water-use efficiency (W) were not significant (P greater-than-or-equal-to 0.203). Water-use efficiency was strongly correlated with DELTA (r = -0.95, P < 0.01). Neither growth trait was correlated with A (r less-than-or-equal-to 0.05, P > 0.93) and height was not significantly correlated with DELTA (r = -0.75, P = 0.15). Tree diameter and DELTA were significantly correlated (r = -0.92, P = 0.03). These results were strongly influenced by a single family. Both the variation in DELTA and correlation trends between DELTA and the growth traits height and diameter suggest the possibility of selecting for high water-use efficiency with the potential for simultaneous gains in height and diameter growth.

DT Article
DE COMMON GARDEN EXPERIMENT; LIFE HISTORY; LIZARDS
AB 1. Neonate growth rate variation between low- and high-altitude populations of Sceloporus jarrovi was investigated using a common garden experiment to investigate the relative importance of proximate and ultimate causation to explain interpopulation variation in growth rates.
   2. There were no differences between source populations in snout-vent length (SVL) growth rate, but there was a significant interaction of source population with sex. Low-altitude males grew more slowly than low-altitude females (0.136 mm day-1 vs 0.248 mm day-1), whereas the reverse was true for high-altitude individuals (0. 185 mm day 1 vs 0. 164 mm day-1). Males from both populations did not have different SVL growth rates, but females did.
   3. There were no significant differences in body mass (BM) change between populations, but the sex-source population interaction was significant.
   4. Neonates showed litter effects in SVL, BM, SVL growth and BM change. These differences could not be explained by maternal effects due to female body mass or litter size, suggesting a genetic basis for growth rate differences.
   5. The implications of these results for genetic differences in individual growth rate and for other life-history characteristics are discussed.

AB Chlorophyll a, phycoerythrin and photosynthetic responses of branches of the red alga Gracilaria tikvahiae were compared in an acclimation study. Plants cultured from carpospores, and freshly collected from a protected mangrove estuary and an exposed coast were used. Each population showed similar but significantly distinct photosynthetic responses to temperature and salinity during culturing, in the initial 7-day acclimation period, during a factorial combination of two temperatures and two salinities over 14 days, and after placement in a common garden set of conditions for a final 14 days. In contrast, the pigment levels, which were originally different, were similar at the end of the study. The study suggests that each population, all originating from Tampa Bay, Florida, shows ecotypic differentiation as well as broad tolerances to salinity and temperature.

AB Weekly values of water relations parameters of four black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) populations growing in a common garden north of Quebec City were obtained by pressure-volume curve analysis from mid-May to mid-October 1991. Two of the four populations originated from the province of Quebec, and two were from Ontario. Within each geographical location, one population was from a lowland site (peat soil) and the other from an upland site (well-drained sandy soil). Differences between upland and lowland populations were small but statistically significant for the majority of water relations parameters in the Ontario pair. No significant differences could be found between populations in the Quebec pair. In the Ontario pair, trees from the lowland site exhibited some traits that could be associated with water-stress tolerance, such as lower relative water content at turgor loss point, lower maximum modulus of elasticity, lower osmotic potential at turgor loss point, and higher osmotic amplitude for turgor maintenance. The seasonal pattern of water relations parameters was similar among the four populations and also similar to patterns that have been reported for other species. The seasonal variations in water relations parameters followed phenological changes that were driven by seasonal shifts in environmental parameters.

AB Embryonic development times and the stage at which embryonic diapause occurs varied dramatically among 23 populations of the Melanoplus sanguinipes/devastator species complex in California, USA. Grasshoppers were collected from a wide range of latitudes (32-degrees-57N to 41-degrees-20N) and altitudes (10 m to 3031 m), spanning much of the variation in climatic conditions experienced by these insects in California. When reared in a ''common garden'' in the laboratory, total embryonic development times were positively correlated to the mean annual temperature of the habitat from which the grasshoppers were collected (varying from about 19 days to 32 days when reared at 27-degrees-C). These grasshoppers overwinter as diapausing eggs and the proportion of embryonic development completed prior to diapause was significantly higher in populations collected from cool habitats (>70%) than in populations collected from warm environments (<26%). The length of pre-diapause development time is determined by the stage of embryonic development at which diapause occurs, and varies considerably among populations of these grasshoppers; grasshoppers from warmer environments tend to diapause at very early stages of embryogenesis, while grasshoppers from cooler environments diapause at very late stages. The combined effect of variation in embryonic development times and variation in the stage at which diapause occurs results in a dramatic reduction in the time needed to hatch in the spring; populations from warm environments required up to 20 days (at 27-degrees-C) to hatch while populations from cool environments required as few as 5 days to complete embryonic development prior to hatching. Egg size also varied significantly among populations, but tended to be larger in populations with shorter embryonic development times. Significant family effects were observed for development time and stage of diapause, suggesting significant heritabilities for these traits, although maternal effects may also contribute to family level variation. We interpret these findings to support the hypothesis that embryonic development time and the stage of embryonic diapause have evolved as adaptations to prevailing season lengths in the study populations.

ID TEMPERATURE
AB Uses of recently available calorimetry technology are explored for measurement of metabolic activity - temperature relations in coast redwoods (Sequoia sempevirens (D. Don) Endl.). These redwoods were collected from different parts of the native range and grown in a common-garden plantation. Analysis of metabolic activity from 10 to 55 degrees C was used to examine site adaptedness of respiratory metabolism in 16 representative clones of coast redwood. Apparent activation energies changed markedly over the range 12-52 degrees C, but the patterns of change were similar for clones from five geographical regions and thus appear to be general for the species. However, high-temperature stability, the temperature of peak activity, and the peak metabolic heat rate differed substantially among samples from the five regions. Additional variability in high temperature stability and the temperature of peak activity was measured between trees from the same stands within regions. We suggest that the observed regional and clonal variations in high-temperature stability, the temperature of peak activity, and the peak metabolic heat rate are biologically meaningful. These may be used both to understand the adaptive architecture of coast redwood and to select clones likely to be adapted to particular sites or defined ranges of sites.

ID PATTERNS
AB Seed was obtained from four populations of an endangered perennial daisy, Leucochrysum albicans (syn. Helipterum albicans), in Tasmania. These populations were from montane basaltic soils, montane limestone soils, lowland basaltic soils and lowland soils derived from mudstone. All populations had their highest percentage germination at 20 degrees C, but the montane populations had lower germination rates than the lowland populations, especially at lower temperatures. The low altitude populations exhibited mon rapid germination than the high altitude populations. In a glasshouse experiment droughting decreased the growth of the provenances from limestone and mudstone, while having little effect on the basalt provenances, mulching increased the growth of the lowland provenances relative to the highland provenances, and the application of fertiliser depressed the growth of the montane basalt provenance. Variations in leaf characteristics and flowering rates were evident between either provenance or treatment. The marked geographic variation in germination, morphology and ecological responses indicates that it is important to maintain the species over its full environmental range.

DE JUGLANS NIGRA L; SEED SOURCE; TREE IMPROVEMENT
AB In 1967, black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) seedlings of different geographic origins were planted in seven common garden plantations within the species' natural range in the midwestern United States. After 22 years, height, d.b.h., and survival measurements revealed that local trees (from within 100 miles north and south of the plantation) had the greatest survival at all locations, and those from areas 200 miles south of the planting site grew significantly taller than trees from more southerly locations. Survival in the Minnesota and Iowa plantations was highly correlated with latitude and longitude of seed source; northern and western seed sources had higher survival. Height and d.b.h. correlations were highly significant in all plantations. High heritabilities implied that much of the geographic variation in height and d.b.h. is under genetic control and that seed source selection should be included in black walnut improvement programs.

AB Solanum megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum are two phenetically similar wild potato (Solanum sect. Petota) species, classified in series Megistacroloba, that together are distributed from southern Peru to northwestern Argentina. They have variously been synonymized, recognized as varieties of S. megistacrolobum, or recognized as distinct species. This study examines 26 morphological characters of 115 living accessions of these two species, plus six accessions of two related species in series Megistacroloba, S. boliviense and S. sogarandinum. All measurements were taken from living accessions planted in a common garden plot. Solanum megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum could be distinguished phenetically only by a combination of the 21 characters that showed statistically significant differences between the two taxa. No individual characters provided consistent discrimination, and there was frequent overlap of ''species-specific'' characters between taxa. Our results most closely fit the contemporary treatment of S. megistacrolobum and S. toralapanum at the varietal level.

AB Blue oak (Quercus douglasii) is a deciduous tree species endemic to California that currently exhibits poor seedling survival to sapling age classes. We used common garden techniques to examine how genetic variation at regional and local scales affected phenotypic expression in traits affecting oak seedling growth and survival. Between-population variation was examined for seedlings grown from acorns collected from a northern, mesic population and a southern, xeric population. Within-population variation was examined by comparing seedlings from different maternal families within the mesic population. Acorns were planted into neighborhoods of an annual dicot (Erodium botrys), an annual grass (Bromus diandrus), and a perennial bunchgrass (Nassella pulchra). By varying the species composition of herbaceous neighborhoods into which acorns were planted, the interactive effects of competition and acorn germplasm source on phenotypic expression could also be examined. Potential maternal effects, expressed as variation in acorn size, were assessed by weighing each acorn before planting. Probability of seedling emergence increased significantly with acorn size in the xeric population but not in the mesic population. Similarly, the effect of acorn size on seedling leaf area, stem weight, and root weight was also population-dependent. At a within-population level, acorn size effects on seedling traits varied significantly among maternal families. In addition to acorn size effects, rates of oak seedling emergence were also dependent on an interaction of population source and competitive environment. Interactions between maternal family and competitive environment in the expression of seedling leaf characters suggest the possibility of genetic variation for plasticity in traits such as specific leaf area. Using carbon isotope discrimination (Delta) as an index of relative water-use efficiency (WUE), higher water use efficiency was indicated for oak seedlings grown in the annual plant neighborhoods compared to seedlings grown in the bunchgrass neighborhood. This trend may represent an adaptive plastic response because, compared to the bunchgrass neighborhood, soil water depletion was more rapid within annual plant neighborhoods.

AB Three experiments were conducted to evaluate net photosynthesis in black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa Torrey & Gray) from mesic and xeric regions of Washington. In 1986, six clones each from the lower Nisqually (mesic) and Yakima (xeric) river valleys and growing in a common garden were measured for their photosynthetic rates. On 2 clear days in summer, Yakima clones had significantly (p less than or equal to 0.10) higher rates (means: 32 and 25 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) than Nisqually clones (means: 25 and 22 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)). The next year, cuttings from these clones were potted, grown separately for 2 months in a maritime (Puyallup, Wash.) and a continental climate (Wenatchee, Wash.), and then transferred to growth chambers in Seattle, Wash. Photosynthetic rates were determined at four light levels (200, 500, 800, and 1500 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and two temperatures (24 and 32 degrees C). Yakima plants had significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) higher rates at high light (20 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1)) and also at moderate light in high temperature than Nisqually plants (16 mu mol CO2 m(-2) s(-1) in high light). Significant acclimation (p less than or equal to 0.01) was also revealed: at the two moderate light levels in high temperatures the Wenatchee-grown plants, regardless of source, had higher rates than those grown at Puyallup. In 1991, eight clones from the lower elevation, xeric region of the Yakima and eight from the upper elevation, mesic region were selected in a Puyallup stoolbed, and their photosynthesis and water-use efficiency were measured on a clear summer day. Lower elevation plants had a higher photosynthetic rate than those from the upper elevations along the Yakima; values were similar to those of 1986. The pattern for water-use efficiency was reversed; values were 56 mu mol CO2/mol H2O for the lower and 84 mu mol CO2/mol H2O for the upper Yakima plants. These three experiments provide evidence for significant genetic variation in photosynthetic processes both between and within river valleys.

AB Using the free-feeding beetle Chrysomela confluens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), we examined the hypothesis that naturally occurring hybrid zones between two cottonwood species are ''sinks'' or centers of insect abundance. Over a 3-yr period, we found that 94% of the C confluens population was restricted to a 13-km hybrid zone, which represents <3% of the cottonwood population.
   Of several potential mechanisms tested, expanded host phenology in the hybrid zone, relative to pure zones, best explained the distribution of C confluens which is dependent upon newly flushed leaves for optimal growth and reproduction. The hybrid zone is a superior beetle habitat because: (1) early leaf flush in the hybrid zone provides the first source of food for beetles in spring and (2) staggered leaf phenologies in the hybrid zone allow beetles to shift onto newly flushed Fremont trees as foliage of sympatric hybrid and narrowleaf trees declines in quality. This shift by ovipositing females can result in a 600% increase in fecundity relative to nonshifting females. Additionally, a 10-yr common garden experiment shows that there is a strong genetic component to the timing of leaf flush, which suggests a long-term stability of resources in the hybrid zone that beetles can rely on.
   For C confluens, the hybrid zone is a ''phenological sink'' that increases beetle fecundity and leads to chronically high herbivory year after year. Because movement from the hybrid zone reduces fecundity, emigration into adjacent pure zones is likely hindered. This hypothesis requires staggered phenologies between overlapping host species; it probably does not require hybridization between host species. Further, this hypothesis may in part explain frequent outbreaks of insects in nurseries and plantations. Thus, two distinct mechanisms have been identified that result in increased insect abundance in plant hybrid zones: ''phenological sinks'' resulting from staggered plant phenologies and ''hybrid sinks'' resulting from increased susceptibility of hybrids to insect attack. Such studies suggest that hybrid zones are important natural laboratories for the study of plant-herbivore interactions.

AB I investigated allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in the Jerusalem artichoke, Helianthus tuberosus L. (Asteraceae), a clonal pseudoannual that is an herbaceous ramet for one season, but propagates as a perennial through tubers that quickly dissociate from the parent plant.
   H. tuberosus ramets grown from tubers allocated 24% of their end-of-season biomass to tubers and 9% to sexual organs, with substantial variation attributable to four genetic lines cultured from eastern Iowa. Experimentally induced failure of sexual reproduction increased allocation to asexual reproduction under common garden conditions. Plants with inflorescence buds removed produced more (82 vs. 69) and larger (4.4 g vs. 3.8 g) tubers than those with unlimited sexual reproduction. Total biomass allocation to reproduction in plants receiving the bud-removal treatment was equivalent to combined allocation to sexual and asexual reproduction in plants that produced flower heads and achenes. This suggests a complete diversion of resources from sexual to asexual reproduction when sexual reproduction is thwarted. Aboveground plant size did not change with treatment.
   These results suggest a flexible life history that can respond to sexual failure resulting from low pollinator availability or damage to inflorescences from herbivory or weather, with enhanced facultative production of asexual tubers capable of sexual reproduction the following year. Hereditary variation in allocation leaves open the possibility of local adaptation.

AB We conducted a series of field experiments to assess whether cool-season grasses were important in maintaining populations of the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), between the summer harvest and fall sowing of winter cereals. All six grass species in a common garden in northern Utah supported aphid population growth from May to September 1991, although aphid densities were unusually low on mature foliage in july. Under conditions of little or no plant competition, each grass species produced at least a few fall tillers before mature shoots had senesced completely and hence provided a continuous source of food for aphids. Indian ricegrass was a consistently good host and bluebunch wheatgrass was a consistently poor one, but the relative suitabilities of the six hosts varied considerably over the season. Neither plant water content nor total nitrogen was correlated with differences in aphid performance among hosts. We conducted a greenhouse experiment to compare estimates of plant quality under field and greenhouse conditions. Differences in aphid performance among hosts in the greenhouse resembled those observed in the field early in the season, but not during the critical ''oversummering'' period.

AB Recent research has emphasized the importance of investigating the reaction norms of quantitative traits to understand evolution in natural environments. In this study, genetic differences in reaction norms among eight populations of the grass Bouteloua rigidiseta were examined using clonal replicates of genotypes planted in a common garden with two levels of competition (single B. rigidiseta without competition and single B. rigidiseta surrounded by four Erioneuron pilosum). The populations were found to be genetically differentiated for a variety of traits. Differences in reaction norms of size-specific fecundity (spikelet clusters per tiller number) were detected among the populations: some showed little response to competition; in others size-specific fecundity was much greater in the absence of competition. This divergence in reaction norms among these populations may be the result of past selection (including the cost of plasticity), or genetic drift.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English

ID FUNARIA-HYGROMETRICA; GENETIC-STRUCTURE; MITT BROTH
AB The so-called copper mosses include a number of rare species that exhibit very broad intercontinental geographic distributions comprised of highly disjunct occurrences. In one species, Scopelophila cataractae, only the haploid gametophyte generation exists in the United States, although sporophytes occur in tropical America and in Asia. Gametophytic plants were sampled from all U.S. populations to determine what factors limit sexual reproduction. More than 50% of the plants in every population were devoid of gametangia, and no population contained plants with both male and female gametangia. Morphological differences between plants from putative male and female populations (when each was interpreted to be unisexual) suggested gametophytic sexual dimorphism, but generalized sexual differences were not maintained under common garden conditions. Experimental growth of plants on soils with low, moderate, or high concentrations of metals demonstrated extensive morphological variability, and thus genetic polymorphism, among five asexual populations. Morphological traits were also significantly plastic in response to differ-ing soil types, but there was no evidence of differences in patterns of plasticity between sexes or populations. All populations produced higher cover area and individual plants formed larger leaves on the most highly metal-contaminated soil. Populations varied significantly in growth on less contaminated soil, again suggesting genetic variability.

AB Nested designs incorporating provenances and families and clones within provenances were used in two common garden tests near Thunder Bay, Ont. (48-degrees-N, 84-degrees-W) to evaluate genetic variation in growth and sylleptic branching among and within populations of tamarack (Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch) from 46-degrees-N, 80-degrees-W to 53-degrees-N, 93-degrees-W. At 7 and 8 years there was a north-south trend of increasing height among provenances. Genetic variation in height was related to both rate and duration of shoot elongation, but latitudinal variation in shoot growth mainly resulted from differences in late-season elongation. There was substantial genetic variance in height within populations, and broad-sense heritability based on pooled variances was 0.23 for one test population at 8 years and 0.11 for the second at 7 years. The more vigorous southern provenances had a greater potential for sylleptic branching in the test area than northern sources, and wide within-population variation in syllepsis was under stronger genetic control than growth (broad-sense heritability = 0.47 in year 6). Patterns of genetic variation observed in the study were not congruent with patterns of morphological and allozyme variation previously reported for the sampled populations.

AB Genetic variation was examined within and among populations of red alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) from elevational gradients in four river drainages of the Pacific Northwest. Wind-pollinated progenies of 120 trees were grown for 3 years in a common garden environment and measured for growth and shoot phenology. Variation in top weight, bud flush, and leaf abscission was analyzed in relation to native climate and elevation and compared with sympatric species. Strong geographic patterns of variation were observed for all measured traits, apparently reflecting adaptations to highly variable climates within the region studied. Growth traits were correlated with temperature amplitude and length of growing season. Growth rhythm in bud flushing and growth cessation was related to two important environmental cues, spring thermal sums and fall frost dates. Overall levels of variation in red alder appeared to be similar to several sympatric conifers, although variation within populations of red alder was lower. The latter finding may be due to the demography of the riparian populations sampled, or perhaps a characteristic of the species and its colonizing life history.

AB The effect of experimental conditions on the growth rates of sporelings and tips of four Gracilaria species has been studied. The hypothesis tested was that exposure to suboptimal environmental conditions might result in increased growth rate under optimal conditions. Sporelings of G. tikvahiae and G. verrucosa did not confirm this hypothesis. However, G. conferta tips and G. domingensis sporelings showed an inverse relationship between indoor (hardening) and outdoor (common garden) growth rates. No single set of abiotic conditions during hardening resulted in optimum growth of all 4 species of Gracilaria during the common garden phase. The difference between the two pairs of species might be a result of their geographical distribution. The first pair has a very wide distribution with a lower optimal temperature, while the second pair is limited to a warm environment.

AB Provisional seed zones and breeding zones were developed for Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) in the Siskiyou National Forest in southwestern Oregon. Zones were based on maps of genetic variation patterns obtained by evaluating genotypes of trees from 260 locations in the region. Genotypes controlling growth vigor and growth rhythm were assessed in a common garden. Within the Forest, three breeding blocks were recommended, with different numbers of elevational bands in each block: from 0 to 610 meters, from 611 to 838 meters, and then a series of bands 152 meters wide at higher elevations.

AB Many small temperate-zone birds fatten in winter and use this reserve when food becomes unavailable. The winter body mass of migratory Dark-eyed Juncos (Junco hyemalis) usually is greater where severe weather is more frequent, i.e., at higher latitudes or altitudes. The mechanism responsible for this geographic variation is unknown, and we asked whether geographically separated populations are composed of birds with different capacities or tendencies to fatten. We sampled the lipid index (LI, grams of lipid per gram of lean dry mass) of free-living juncos at three latitudes in two winters and found geographic variation. However, the pattern of variation in LI at the three latitudes was not consistent, either within or between winters.
   We also displaced wintering juncos from northern, intermediate, and southern sites and exposed them to a common environment in Indiana. One group of displaced birds was released in natural junco habitat (during three winters), and another was held outdoors in captivity (during two winters). Many released birds remained nearby, and when we recaptured some of them in late winter the LIs of the three geographic subgroups were statistically indistinguishable. It was also indistinguishable from the LI of juncos sampled at that time from the free-living Indiana population. Among the displaced birds that we held captive, we found no differences among the geographic subgroups either in LI or total body mass. In one of the years, late-winter LI and body mass of the captives did not differ from values for the released group or from values of newly caught Indiana juncos, but in the second year values for the captives were lower.
   Our results indicate that geographic variation in winter fattening of juncos is not a population-specific trait that persists independently of current environmental information and that it probably reflects a response to local environmental conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment using free-living birds to test the role of the environment in maintaining geographic variation in a life history trait in the nonbreeding period.

AB To assess whether plant phenology may affect potential for host shifts, S. altissima and S. gigantea were monitored in the field in Minnesota (both host races), in Pennsylvania (S. altissima, sole host), and in a Pennsylvania common garden of both host plants from both sites. Plant height was measured every other day, and growth rates were calculated through the oviposition period in the field and season-long in the common garden. Greenhouse-grown S. gigantea from both locations were subjected to oviposition by Minnesota Eurosta to compare galling susceptibility. Minnesota hosts had more comparable growth rates and more intraspecific variability than the same species in Pennsylvania. S. gigantea growth peaked earlier and fell more rapidly than that of S. altissima for all populations, suggesting an earlier, narrower window of host suitability. Pennsylvania S. gigantea will support gall formation, but ramet growth rate was significantly less than that of Minnesota S. gigantea under greenhouse conditions, and Minnesota Eurosta strongly preferred Minnesota ramets to those from Pennsylvania. Variations in daily growth rate fluctuations between species may confound Eurosta's detection of suitable hosts. These results indicate a higher probability of a host shift occurring in Minnesota than in Pennsylvania and may indicate why colonization of S. gigantea has not occurred in Pennsylvania.

AB The association between tall fescue and its endophyte is the best-known case of a symbiosis that is widespread in grasses, especially in cool-season, pooid grasses.  Field and herbarium surveys have shown that many grasses are endophyte infected, often at 100% frequency.  Ubiquitous endophyte infection with a host species is prima facie evidence that the association is mutualistic since ther are mechanisms by which individuals could lose the infection (e.g. extended seed dormancy). Studies have shown that the frequency of endophyte infection tends to increase over time, suggesting an ecological advantage for infected (E+) plants. A 3 year demographic experiment with tall fescue in a grassland community in Louisiana revealed that E+ plants had significantly higher survival, growth and flowering rates than E- plants. The mean fitness of E+ ball fescue was twice the mean fitness of E- plants. Greenhouse and common garden experiments have shown that E+ plants generally perform better than E- plants in mixtures. In order to separate the effects of endophyte-induced physiological changes in hosts versus protection against herbivory, a series of factorial competition experiments have been conducted where infection status, insect herbivory, density, and the identity of competing species were controlled. Preliminary results indicate that both infection and herbivory can affect competitive interactions among plants. The high frequency of seed-borne Acremonium endophytes within species of genera like Festuca, Lolium, Poa, and Stipa suggests that the association originated before speciation within these genera. The association of clavicipitaceous fungi with grasses spans a great range of interactions from localized ovarian parasites (e.g. Claviceps), systemic, choke-inducing fungi (e.g. Atkinsonella, Balansia, Epichloe), epiphytic fungi (Atkinsonella, some species of Balansia, Myriogenospora), and completely seed-borne, asymptomatic endophytes such as in Lolium. The question of what type of associations are ancestral and which are derived remains unanswered. The potential of these fungi for contagious spread and the presence or absence of a sexual reproductive system may influence genetic variation within taxa, and therefore their evolution and coevolution with grasses. Seed-borne Acremonium en-dophytes do not spread contagiously or reproduce sexually. They are reproductively isolated from other endophytes and can become genetically differentiated by the accumulation of random mutations. Isozyme electrophoresis has revealed abundant genetic variation in many Acremonium endophytes from wild grasses but, in contrast, artificial selection of cultivated grasses apparently has eliminated much genetic variation of endophytes. Future research on endophytes will focus on quantifying genetic variation for important traits such as alkaloid production, stroma formation, and host compatibility.

AB Patterns of genetic variation in gas-exchange physiology were analyzed in a 15-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation that contains 25 populations grown from seed collected from across the natural distribution of the species. Seed was collected from 33-degrees 30' to 53-degrees 12' north latitude and from 170 m to 2930 m above sea level, and from the coastal and interior (Rocky Mountain) varieties of the species. Carbon isotope discrimination (DELTA) ranged from 19.70(parts per thousand) to 22.43(parts per thousand) and was closely related to geographic location of the seed source. The coastal variety (20.50 (SE = 0.21)parts per thousand) was not significantly different from the interior variety (20.91 (0.15)parts per thousand). Instead, most variation was found within the interior variety; populations from the southern Rockies had the highest discrimination (21.53 (0.20)parts per thousand) (lowest water-use efficiency). Carbon isotope discrimination (DELTA), stomatal conductance to water vapor (g), the ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentration (c(i)/c(a)), and intrinsic water-use efficiency (A/g) were all correlated with altitude of origin (r = 0.76, 0.73, 0.74, and -0.63 respectively); all were statistically significant at the 0.01 level. The same variables were correlated with both height and diameter at age 15 (all at P less-than-or-equal-to 0.0005). Observed patterns in the common garden did not conform to our expectation of higher WUE, measured by both A/g and DELTA, in trees from the drier habitats of the interior, nor did they agree with published in situ observations of decreasing g and DELTA with altitude. The genetic effect opposes the altitudinal one, leading to some degree of homeostasis in physiological characteritics in situ.

AB Hatchling Sceloporus undulatus elongatus from Washington Co., Utah and S. u. garmani from Woods Co., Oklahoma were raised to maturity and reproduction under identical laboratory conditions with ad libitum food availability. Growth, allometry, age and size of maturity, clutch size and egg mass were compared among lab-raised cohorts from the two populations, among lab-raised and field-caught animals (including their field-caught mothers) and, for growth, with values obtained by previously published field studies on the same or nearby populations. For all traits population differences observed in previous field studies and current field samples resulted from both a plastic response to proximate environmental conditions and intrinsic (possibly genetic) difference. The most plastic traits were growth and age of maturity. Cohorts from both populations expressed the ability to mature in less than 6 months in the laboratory but only the S.u. garmani express early maturity in the field. Allometric differences generated during growth in the lab were not observed in field samples but may reflect an adaptive physiological difference. The least plastic trait was egg mass. The only trait for which the rank order of the difference in the field was reversed in the lab was growth rate. S.u. elongatus grew significantly faster than S.u. garmani in the lab but much slower in the field. The tendency of S.u. garmani females to breed at minimum size of maturity may be greater than that of S.u. elongatus.

AB Experiments were conducted over several years to assess the effects of the three most abundant herbivores (a thrips, a spittlebug, and a plume moth) on the growth and reproduction of their long-lived, iteroparous host plant. In a greenhouse experiment, thrips reduced root biomass of seedlings, but not shoot biomass. No correlation was found between density of thrips and change in aboveground area of plants after monitoring for 3 yr in the field. Thrips fed on the phyllaries and corollas of flower heads, as well as on leaves, and were particularly damaging to ray petals. Placed in artificial arrays, flower heads with rays damaged by thrips were less likely to be visited by pollinators than were undamaged flower heads.
   Plants in a common garden were subjected to three seasons of feeding by either spittle-bugs, plume moth caterpillars, both, or neither. Survival, growth, and flower production were measured for those 3 yr and for an additional 3 yr following the herbivory treatments. Plant survival was unaffected by these insect herbivores, although gophers (Thomomys bottae) were a major source of mortality. Plants with caterpillars produced more rosettes than those without moths. By consuming apical buds the caterpillars released axillary buds, thereby causing plants to produce more side rosettes. This difference in architecture did not result in an increase in flower production. Plants that had experienced 3 yr of spittle-bug or caterpillar attack produced fewer flower heads than controls during their 3rd yr. One year later, and after the herbivory treatments were discontinued, plants that had been damaged by spittlebugs (but not plume moth caterpillars) still produced fewer flowers than those in other treatments. Thereafter, no long-term effects of herbivory could be detected.
   All three herbivores were found to adversely affect some components of plant growth and reproduction. Because they are consistently abundant at Bodega Bay, these herbivores may reduce the fitness of their host plant.

   2. Survival and density also vary among trees within these two habitats; natural enemies and host-plant factors are thought to generate between-habitat variation in Phytomyza densities, while mainly host factors generate within-habitat variation.
   3. We explored the latter by examining the effects of fertilization, clonal variation, exposure to sunlight and site of exposure to attack (forest or open field) on Phytomyza success using potted holly clones in a common garden setting.
   4. Fertilization, clonal variation and site of exposure to attack all influenced various measures of Phytomyza success whereas exposure to sunlight did not.
   5. Fertilized plants had 32% more adult feeding, 47% more ovipositions (as determined by the number of first instar larvae), 9.5% greater larval survival and 7% heavier pupae than did unfertilized plants.
   6. Clonal variation had no influence on adult leafminer feeding, but influenced both oviposition (29% lower on clone 30 than on clones 65 and A1) and larval survival (over 60% higher on clone 65 than on clones A1 and 30).
   7. Plants that were exposed to leafminer attack in a sunny open field had 50% more feeding scars and 82% more first instar larvae than did those exposed in a shaded woodlot. There were no differences in larval survival between the two sites.
   8. Density variation is influenced by adult discrimination among trees by adult leafminers in feeding and oviposition, and by differential mortality and growth of the larvae after oviposition.

TI CONSTRAINTS AND PLASTICITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF JUVENILE
   NEPHILA-CLAVIPES IN MEXICO
SO JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The large, orb-weaving spider Nephila clavipes is found in a diversity of habitats within a narrow latitudinal range in Mexico. This allowed nearly simultaneous study of post-embryonic development of six disjunct populations in dissimilar environments. A common-garden laboratory study utilizing juveniles collected in four sites reinforced the conclusions from the field. The developmental parameters influencing growth in size at ecdysis did not vary within or among populations and may be genetically determined. Although very small juveniles exhibit variation in the growth per ecdysis, larger juveniles exhibit very little variation. These data, compared to data from field and laboratory studies of other tropical populations of N. clavipes, indicate that growth per ecdysis is highly constrained. Thus, this developmental parameter establishes a developmental trajectory that may be genetically determined and therefore subject to natural selection.

AB In order to test the hypothesis that precocious variants might be at a selective advantage in well-weeded sites, open pollinated achenes of Senecio vulgaris L. were collected in eastern Britain from three populations representative of each of five habitat types (botanic gardens, field margins, inland and coastal sandy areas and shingle beaches) some subject to weeding and others not. Progenies of a number of seed-parents (families) were grown in a garden trial, and life-history and reproductive characteristics were recorded, in particular the rate of development from sowing, with synchronous germination, to first fruiting. Populations from botanic gardens were characterized by families exhibiting precocious reproduction, a finding which supports our initial hypothesis. However, a degree of variation was detected in samples from all three botanic gardens - Oxford, Kew and Cambridge - confirming the results of an earlier study of groundsel in the University Botanic Garden, Cambridge. In contrast, samples from maritime shingle beaches had a slower rate of development. There was no evidence of population variation, suggesting that genetic drift or founder effects might be important or that there may be selection for a narrow range of phenotypes, in such areas. Furthermore, at Shingle Street, Suffolk, there was evidence of sharp local differentiation between plants from the shingle beach and from an arable field margin, 50 m away, located behind sea defences. The characteristics of plants from other habitat types are discussed in relation to the apparent selection pressures imposed by different land use. Our results provide evidence of trade-offs in life-history evolution, e.g. the precocious variants were comparatively dwarf at first fruiting and shorter-lived.

AB Fifty clones from each of 4 provenances (Lat. 45-degrees-N to 53-degrees-N at Long. 90-degrees-W) were grown in 2 common garden tests at Lat. 48-degrees-N for 7 years and 5 years respectively. Provenance differences in height were mainly related to the period of shoot elongation, with the most southerly provenance (Lat. 45-degrees-N to 46-degrees-N) continuing elongation later and growing taller than northerly provenances. Clonal variation within provenances was also statistically significant, and broad-sense heritability estimates for      height ranged from 0.04 to 0.19, depending upon degree of microsite variation within provenance blocks. Variation in spring bud break was mostly attributable to differences among clones within provenances, was under moderate genetic control (h2 = 0.21 to 0.47), and generally was not related to the amount of height growth.

DE DODECATHEON; PRIMULACEAE; SYSTEMATICS; MORPHOLOGY; CHROMOSOME NUMBERS;
   COMMON GARDEN STUDIES
AB Dodecatheon pulchellum (Raf.) Merr. is a widespread and morphologically variable species of western North America. Analysis of morphological variation, combined with chromosome counts and evidence from a transplant study, showed this species to consist of two subspecies. Subspecies cusickii is pubescent, mainly diploid, and occurs in the drier parts of the species range. The more variable ssp. pulchellum is glabrous to sparsely pubescent, mainly polyploid, and is widely distributed. Within ssp. pulchellum, three varieties can be recognized: the tall, many-flowered var. alaskanum, of wet, low-elevation habitats; the diminutive var. watsonii, generally of alpine habitats; and the intermediate and widely distributed var. pulchellum. Common garden studies indicate that size differences among these varieties have a genetic basis and that ecological differences exist in D. pulchellum even among morphologically similar forms.

TI GENETIC DIVERSITY IN CANADIAN HARDWOODS - IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSERVATION
SO FORESTRY CHRONICLE
LA English
DT Article
AB Hardwoods are diverse, and they are important components in several forest regions of Canada. Yet low demand from the pulp and paper sector, abundant natural regeneration for several species, and high costs associated with seedling production and plantation establishment have restrained industries and governments from investing intensively into basic biological and genetic research of hardwoods. Recently, new interests have emerged for the utilization and conservation of hardwood species. To devise efficient gene conservation and breeding strategies for hardwoods, knowledge is needed about their genetic structure, genecology, and mating systems. Here we review information on the organization of genetic diversity in the few Canadian hardwood species that have been studied. Results derived from analyses of quantitative characters showed extensive genetic variation among populations and among individuals within populations in all species. Genetic variation among populations was found to be associated with environmental factors, especially for adaptive traits. Levels of genetic diversity were also found high in allozyme genetic markers. The application of molecular genetic markers at the DNA level in monitoring genetic diversity of hardwoods is also discussed. Information available regarding genetic diversity of Canadian hardwoods is insufficient to design efficient gene conservation strategies. Several programs investigating genetic diversity of hardwoods have been initiated in Canada, and should yield urgently needed data.

AB 1. Phosphatase acid (PhA) activity in the digestive gland (hepatopancreas) of the common garden snail Helix aspersa has been investigated using cytochemical methods.
   2. All the cells composing this gland show PhA activity, the distribution pattern differing according to the cell type.
   3. The digestive cells show the most widely distributed reaction product (brush border, phagolysosomes, multivesicular bodies and autophagic vacuoles).
   4. In the excretory cells this activity appears in large sacs, while in the calcium cells the reaction product is abundant in the calcium granules.
   5. Cellular digestion processes performed by each of these cell types is discussed together with their role in the detoxification of heavy elements derived from the environment.

AB Genetic variation in both carbon isotope discrimination and the proportions of leaf and photosynthetic twig tissues were observed in ecotypes of Hymenoclea salsola T.G., a common shrub in the deserts of the western United States, when grown under common garden conditions. These variations were correlated with climatic conditions in the habitats of origin through a model that described the leaf-to-air water vapor gradients experienced by plants during the growing season. Both carbon isotope discrimination and the proportion of leaves in the canopy were lower in plants derived from habitats with higher leaf-to-air water vapor gradients, despite the fact that some of these sites received relatively high amounts of annual precipitation. These patterns were consistent with the notion that plants are able to maintain substantial control of water-use efficiency over large environmental gradients of temperature and moisture availability.

AB Antennaria arcuata (Asteraccae: Inuleae) is a rare sexual diploid species that occurs in three disjunct regions of Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming. Isozyme diversity in six populations of the species from the three regions utilized 26 putative loci to provide clues to its population genetic structure. Results show that, in general, the amount of genetic diversity in A arcuata is very low in comparison to other sexual species of Antennaria. The values of several genetic statistics such as mean number of alleles per locus, proportion of loci polymorphic, and observed heterozygosity, are significantly lower than populations of any of 17 other sexual species of Antennaria that have been studied previously. It is likely that the unusual disjunct and restricted distribution of A. arcuata is partially the result of its unusual ecology, as it occurs in moist basins having high concentrations of salts that are frequently disturbed by large grazing animals. Canonical correspondence analysis shows strong relationships between several edaphic, environmental, and geographic features and the genetic variation in the populations. The migration of A. arcuata to other regions since the end of the Wisconsinan might have been inhibited by the fact that suitable habitats occur as small isolated islands in a sea of inhospitable terrain, the dry sagebrush steppe.

AB In a well-weeded site, selection is likely to favour quick-maturing variants of annual weeds. Variation in rate of development - from sowing, with synchronous germination, to first flowering and fruiting - was studied in experiments with Senecio vulgaris L. from the Botanic Garden of Cambridge University, England. Experiments revealed that the number of nodes on the main axis could not be used a 'genetic marker; for rate of development.
   From a large random sample of seed-parents, progenies were raised from open-pollinated capitula. Family lines differed significantly in rate of development, with markedly different degrees of variation within families. Twenty family lines, representing the extremes of variation, were chosen for further study. In cultivated selfed derivatives, the majority of the seed-parents appeared to be behaving as inbred lines for rate of development. Evidence of genetic segregation was detected in only two out of 20 cases. Using the radiate locus as a marker, there was also evidence for a very small amount of outcrossing, with greater values for radiate than non-radiate seed-parents. In an experiment in which six inbred lines, derived from the original seed-parents, were grown out-of-doors on fertile and infertile soils and on fertile soil in a glasshouse, there was considerable developmental flexibility in a number of heritable traits including rate of development.
   Although the methods of weed control in the Botanic Garden would seem to exert a powerful directional selective force favouring only the quickest-maturing variants of groundsel, a certain amount of variation was nevertheless detected. Many factors are likely to be important in the maintenance of population variation in rate of development in groundsels in the Garden. Several statistically significant lines x soils and lines x places of cultivation were discovered. Thus, the lines did not all behave in the same way in the inside and outside treatments and the rank order of date of maturity of the different lines was not the same in the two soils. This suggests that, in the Garden proper, relative fitness, in the face of weeding pressures, is not fixed but may vary seasonalIy and in soils of different fertility. This behaviour, in a species which is able to reproduce at all seasons of the year, could be a major factor in the maintenance of population variation. Other contributory factors are of great importance, namely, spatial and seasonal variation in the intensity of weeding, developmental flexibility and the effects of predators, pests and diseases.

AB Plants of groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) in the very well-kept University Botanic Garden, Cambridge are quicker in their rate of development than those from sites subject to less regular or no weeding pressure. However, the directional selection pressure favouring precocity has not resulted in population uniformity. In order to generate hypotheses about the development and maintenance of population variation in this annual weed, we have studied the origin and patterns of migration of two genetic variants. Also, we have investigated the history of the oldest established flowerbeds in the Garden, with particular reference to continuity of use and garden practices.
   The Systematic Beds have been in existence for more than 140 years and, despite periods of difficulty, have been subject to regular and frequent weeding.
   Evidence suggests that the radiate variant of groundsel was most likely introduced into the Garden in the late 1890s from plants collected at Bandon Station, County Cork, Ireland. Subsequently, this plant - var. hibernicus Syme - spread to many parts of the Garden but it did not establish itself on the Systematic Beds until 1985. Using the radiate capitulum locus as a marker, our results reveal a consistently very low level of outcrossing in non-radiate plants and a more variable and seasonally higher frequency in radiate plants. In 1987, simazine resistant plants were detected in the Systematic Beds, an area which has never been treated with triazine herbicides. It seems likely that these resistant plants originated from a population of resistant plants on treated ground just outside the western border of the Garden.
   Two models have been devised to explain our findings. The first model postulates that weeding has been too efficient on the Systematic Beds to permit the slower developing radiate plant to establish itself there. A second model, which appears to fit the facts more closely than the first, postulates that the migration of the radiate variant has been restricted by gene flow.

AB In order to investigate population variation and its maintenance in groundsel (Senecio vulgaris L.) growing in the Cambridge University Botanic Garden, experiments have been carried out to study heritable differences in the rate of development of progenies of seed-parents from sites of different history and land use in and round the Garden. There were significant differences between progenies of seed-parents and between samples from different flowerbeds but the oldest beds did not have the quickest developing plants. Such a pattern of behaviour may be related to the fact that all the beds have been well maintained since the 1950s.
   Since its establishment, two distinctive genetic variants have entered the Garden. On average, progenies from radiate and from simazine-resistant seed-parents in the study area were significantly slower to develop than non-radiate simazine-sensitive plants but, in both cases, we also found plants of intermediate rate of development, which might be the result of hybridization between the 'immigrants' and the precociously developing non-radiate, herbicide-sensitive plants. Progenies from seed-parents collected at two sites just outside the boundaries of the Botanic Garden were slower in their rate of development than those from the intensively hand-weeded flowerbeds of the Garden. Samples collected from the same area in different seasons, and grown at the same time, did not differ overall in rate of development, but there were significant differences within flowerbeds.
   Subsets of progenies of a set of seed-parents were grown both in summer and winter. The rank order of maturity was not the same in the two parts of the experiment, indicating that the progeny of different seed-parents have different relative fitness in different times of year. This behaviour, in a species which is capable of reproducing at all seasons of the year, could be a major factor in the maintenance of population variation in the Garden proper.

AB C-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of intact webs from the common garden spider Araneus diadematus has been used to demonstrate that: (I) water retention is an important role for the viscid coating of capture thread; (II) the elasticity of capture thread results from water-induced mobility at a molecular level (III) the organization and composition of structural and capture thread are different, even in the absence of coating; and (IV) glycoproteins may have a more important presence and structural role than previously realized. Different C-13-labelling patterns of webs were achieved by feeding spiders either with [C-13]glucose or with [C-13]amino acids.

AB Reproductive and growth parameters of Atriplex canescens were examined in a common garden study. Cloned ramets of male, female, and hermaphrodite individuals from two natural populations were planted in irrigated and nonirrigated portions of the garden. Sexual differences in growth and flowering schedules suggest tradeoffs in resource allocation between growth and reproduction. Males flowered with the greatest frequency and intensity while producing the smallest growth parameters. Females had the largest measures of vegetative growth, but flowered with the least frequency and intensity. Hermaphrodites appear to have a biology distinct from males and females, being more like females in growth and more like mates in reproduction.

AB Isozymes and morphological traits were used to explore the organization of genetic variation within and among seven natural populations of the wild soybean, Glycine soja Sieb. and Zucc., from central Japan. A total of 111 individuals were scored for their genotype at 49 gene loci resolved from 20 enzyme systems and one seed protein. The average values for polymorphism (P; 99% criterion), number of alleles per locus (A), gene diversity (H(EXP)) and proportion of heterozygotes observed (H(OBS)) were 0.14, 1.1, 0.05 and 0, respectively. Over 60% of the isozyme variation [as measured by gene differentiation (G(ST))] was distributed among populations. A canonical discriminant analysis using allele frequencies demonstrated that differentiation among populations was due largely to differences in allele frequency rather than to the presence or absence of specific alleles. Estimates of phenotypic variation were obtained by examining 31 traits in two common garden experiments. In both cases, approximately 30% of total phenotypic variation occurred among populations. Canonical discriminant analysis demonstrated that populations have diverged most for traits related to flower size, leaf shape and yield. The levels and distributions of variation were much different for biochemical and morphological traits; however, the two data types revealed similar patterns of population differentiation.

AB Three plants from each of 10 populations of the black biotype of proso millet (Panicum miliaceum) were grown in a common garden in London, Ontario. Seeds were collected from individual plants as they ripened. Each seed was identified as to location on the plant and weighed separately. Mean seed weight decreased over the growing season, both on individual inflorescences and on entire plants. Despite this trend, seeds at the upper end of the weight range were produced throughout the season. The decline in the mean resulted from an increasing proportion of smaller seeds. There was also increased variability in seed weight later in the growing season. In subsequent germination tests there was no discernable relationship between total percent viability and date of seed ripening. Total percent viability was above 70% for each sam lin date.

SO CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE
   FORESTIERE
LA English
DT Note
AB A new site-specific approach to defining seed zones in North American conifers is described.  Using focal point seed zones, an individual site to be reforested becomes the focal point, and a unique seed zone is established for that site as needed.  This approach depends upon (i) obtaining good comparative data in adaptive characteristics from throughout the range to be regenerated based upon a series of short-term growth tests in a common garden and (or) greenhouse and (ii) graphic analysis of multivariate summary scores by geographic information systems software to delimit boundaries of unique seed zones for any location to be reforested.  A sample focal point seed zone is delineated for jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) reforestation of a site in northern Ontario.  This approach has considerable potential to help prevent decreased growth and yield due to the planting of maladapted seed.

AB Reciprocal transplant and "common garden" experiments were done to distinguish the genetic and environmental components of geographic variation in growth, development and morphological characters of Mallard Ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) from California, USA and Manitoba, Canada. Most of the variation in growth and development could be attributed to differences in nesting phenology and local environmental conditions. Differences in morphological characters typical of birds in the two wild populations could be induced by transplanting young between localities. All differences between populations disappeared in the F1 offspring from captive breeding crosses, reared in a common environment. These results suggest that population-level variation in growth, development and morphology of Mallards in the wild is environmentally induced.

AB Agrostis capillaris has spread throughout New Zealand since its introduction 130 or more years ago.  Genecological variation is investigated for clues to its success.  Inflorence number, time to 50% inflorescence emergence, time to 50% anthesis, and length of longest lamina and of longest stem were recorded for samples of 15 populations from a range of habitats in southern New Zealand, and for a collection from Campbell Island, grown together in a common garden in Dunedin.  Differences between populations were not significantly related to major environmental trends, such as altitude and latitude; there was no evidence for the formation of ecotypes within the species.  Populations collected from the same habitat type (e.g., alpine, or dry grassland) did not exhibit comparable floral behaviour.  There were significant differences between some populations in the time to 50% completion of inflorescence emergence and anthesis, but no significant differences among populations in the time interval between the two floral events.  Differences between genotypes within populations were of similar magnitude to those between populations.  Maximum stem lengths differed significantly within but not between populations.  The collection from Campbell Island had longer leaves and stems than those from mainland New Zealand, perhaps due to a different original seed source.  Explanations for these results are discussed in terms of genetic divergence, plasticity, within-population variation, sampling methods, and non-linear adaptive trends.

AB Fifteen populations of the naturalised grass, Agrostis capillaris, sampled from southern New Zealand, were examined for responses to a range of levels of light, fertility, and water availability.  Populations from open, dry areas had genetically low, but plastic, allocation to shoots.  Populations from shady areas were more upright than average, and had greater leaf areas, whereas a lawn population was prostrate, but had high allocation to shoots.  There was evidence of genecological variation in response to the marked site differences in soil-water availability.  Population-based variation in specific leaf area was correlated with rainfall and soil nitrogen and phosphate levels.  Differences between populations in other characters did not correlate with environmental trends.  Responses indicate some adaptation of populations to their local environments in New Zealand, but also high within-population variation and some instances of nonadaptation.  Plasticity is high-as much as 80% of the total variation between treatments - as is typical for a weedy, invasive species.  Plasticity, coupled with some genecological differentiation, seems the most likely explanation for the widespread distribution, both spatially and ecologically, of Agrostis capillaris in New Zealand.

AB To determine if patterns of growth and physiology of Thuja occidentalis differed between dry and wet habitats or were site specific within habitats, three cliff and three swamp populations in southern Ontario, Canada, were intensively investigated. The average annual increases in height, basal diameter, and estimated oven dry mass were determined for all trees in four 16 m2 quadrats per site. The net photosynthetic response to photosynthetically active radiation was measured in situ at each site and on potted cliff and swamp saplings kept in a mesic common garden. Possible environmental factors controlling growth, such as tissue nutrient levels and canopy shading, were also investigated. Significant differences were found among the six sites in all three measures of productivity, in the maximum net photosynthetic rate at light saturation (P(max)), in the foliar levels of N, P, Ca, and the N: P ratio, and in the degree of canopy shading. Variations in all these characteristics were site specific and independent of habitat type. Significant differences between cliffs and swamps were found only in the foliar levels of Mg (cliff > swamp). All foliar nutrient levels (with the possible exception of P at one cliff site) were above values considered limiting. Plants in the common garden had the same photosynthetic light response as their in situ counter-parts. There was no correspondence among the site-specific pattems of productivity, P(max), foliar nutrients, and canopy shading. It is concluded that the factors controlling the growth of T. occidentalis are site but not habitat specific. No evidence of ecotypic differentiation was found.

AB To learn whether vine stems are less structurally stable than shrub stems, I studied the architecture, anatomy, and mechanics of western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum), a plant that grows as a vine when provided with external support but otherwise as a shrub. I assessed the relative structural stabilities of vines and shrubs, and the relative importance of stem morphological vs. material properties for this structural stability using the following types of information: aboveground architecture and biomass distribution, and geometric, anatomical, and material properties of the stems. Shoots that were supported by a fence (vines) had a lower proportion of their dry mass in primary stem and had more aboveground dry mass, more leaves, and a greater total length of stem than did unsupported shoots (shrubs). Both growth forms had about the same proportion of their biomass at a given relative height above the ground. Supported shoots were taller and had lower stem taper (change in radius per unit length of stem) than did unsupported shoots, and, in a common garden, had longer internodes. Xylem of supported shoots had a higher proportion of vessel lumen and lower maximum thicknesses of fiber cell walls than did xylem of unsupported shoots. Supported stems were less stiff (had lower apparent material stiffness in bending) than unsupported stems at diameter less-than-or-equal-to 3.5 cm. A simple model showed that the lower taper and lower material stiffness of vines yielded much lower flexural stiffness in vine than in shrub stems. A second model showed that simplified shrub stems could reach almost 11 m before becoming structurally unstable. Actual shrubs from the modelled environment, however, never exceeded 3.2 m in height. A simplified vine modelled for the same environment would become unstable at 1.2 m, whereas vines in the field can be over 30 m tall. These findings suggest that for poison oak (1) shrubs are overbuilt and vines are underbuilt for self-support, and (2) the higher structural stability of shrubs than vines is due mainly to differences in stem geometry, not to differences in stem material properties.

AB Previous work on colonial hydroids in the genus Hydractinia has demonstrated that colony morphology is highly variable and determines intraspecific competitive ability.  Competitive encounters are known to be common in nature, suggesting that intraspecific competition may be a major selective force acting on morphological variation.  A replicated common garden experiment demonstrated a genetic basis to morphological variation and two data sets provided correlative support for the hypothesis of selection by intraspecific competition.  First, morphologies inferior in competitive ability were less abundant in two adult, postcompetition, samples than in juvenile, precompetition, samples from the same populations.  Second, among eight populations, the relative frequency of different morphologies was correlated with the frequency of intraspecific competition observed in each population.  The direction of selection by competition on the morphological variation present in this species conflicts with recent predictions based on surveys across diverse taxa, suggesting limitations to the inference of competition as a past selective agent on the basis of present day correlations among species.

SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
LA English

ID FOREST; LIANA; COMPETITION; DYNAMICS; LEAVES; LEAF
AB Because of the different mechanical constraints on vines and self-supporting plants, vines are thought to differ from trees and shrubs in a variety of their growth characteristics.  I tested the hypotheses that vines grow faster than shrubs and that supported shoots have delayed leaf expansion relative to stem elongation, using western poison oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum (T. & G.) Greene, a plant that grows as a vine when externally supported but otherwise as a shrub.  In the field, supported shoots (vines) had significantly higher aboveground biomass and relative growth rates than did their paired unsupported shoots (shrubs) growing nearby.  This was not due to differences in leaf phenology, but may have resulted from vines growing into more favorable habitats for growth.  In contrast, whereas 2-yr-old cloned plants in a common garden differed in their stem and internode lengths, they had the same aboveground dry weight, proportion of dry weight that was leaf, and relative rate of increase in primary stem length whether grown with stakes (vines) or without stakes (shrubs).  These results suggest that there is no inherent requirement of vines to grow faster than shrubs.  As hypothesized, leaf elongation was more delayed relative to stem elongation in staked than unstaked individuals in 19 paired plants (each pair cloned from a different source plant).  Thus, physical cues resulting from the presence of support can alter the plant's spatial and temporal patterns of development, but do not necessarily dictate the quantity of biomass that will be produced.

AB Models were developed to describe genetic variation among 201 seedling populations of Pinus ponderosa var. ponderosa in the Inland Northwest of the United States.  Common-garden studies provided three variables that reflected growth and development in field environments and three principal variables that reflected patterns of shoot elongation.  Regression models were developed for describing genetic variation across the landscape.  Using functions of latitude, longitude, and elevation as descriptors, these models produced values of R2 that were as large as 0.66, while averaging 0.39.  The models described genetic variation as occurring along relatively steep elevational clines and gentle geographic (i.e., latitudinal and longitudinal) clines.  An exercise at validating the models with independent data supported their veracity.  Predictions made by the models are applied to limiting seed transfer, designing breeding zones, planning gene conservation programs, interpreting phenotypic variation, and predicting the effects of environmental change on the adaptedness of populations.

AB Gametophytic plants from six populations of the moss Ceratodon purpureus (Hedw.) Brid. were grown on substrates with varied degrees of heavy-metal contamination in order to assess the effects of metal pollution on growth, leaf size, and formation of archegonia and antheridia.  Sex ratios and the overall levels of sexual expression varied greatly among samples from natural populations.  Sex ratios in four populations were biased in favor of females, one in favor of males, and one contained asexual gametophores only.  Experimental substrates had a significant effect on the overall levels of sexual expression but not on the relative frequencies of male versus female stems.  Innate differences in leaf size among populations were maintained in a common garden but leaf size was also affected by substrate.  Patterns of phenotypic plasticity characterizing the six populations were indistinguishable.  Plants from several populations that originated in uncontaminated habitats grew as well on mine soil as plants from a mine-site population, suggesting an absence of ecotypic differentiation.

AB One procedure for guiding seed transfer is to partition the species habitat into zones within which there is little genetic variation from location to location.  This report compares soil types and the existing regional seed zones as bases for classifying geographic genetic variation into zones.  The data used were genotypic values of 135 Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirb.] Franco) trees from 80 locations in a 15,000 km2 area in southwestern Oregon.  Genotypic values were estimated by measuring traits expressing phenology and growth potential of 2-year seedlings in a common-garden experiment.  Neither the soils model nor the seed-zones model satisfactorily classified geographic genetic variation (significant lack of fit).  When physiographic variables (latitude, longitude, elevation, etc.) were added to the models, the added variables accounted for 16% to 23% of the total variation among locations.  Gradients of genetic variation therefore exist within soil types and present seed zones.  These gradients reflect the overall gradients of geographic variation with latitude, longitude, and elevation that occur in the region.  The results suggest that zones constructed from a physiographic model may explain more of the genetic variation in southwestern Oregon than do either soils or seed-zones models.

DE HANDLES; DISCOMFORT; GRIP FORCE; WORK EFFICIENCY
AB An important consideration in tool design is the avoidance of hand discomfort and a reduction of work efficiency by using proper grip designs. To measure grip force distribution on a tool handle, Force Sensing Resistors were calibrated, placed on two different types of grip (wood and foam) and interfaced to a personal computer. The results, using six common garden tools - loppers, hedge shears, shovels, leaf rakes, hoes, garden rakes - indicated a very uneven distribution in grip force, but with the foam grip providing a more uniform distribution. Unfortunately, in most cases, the tool grip force was greater for the foam grip due to the deformation of the foam and a 'loss of control' feeling in the subjects. However, most subjects strongly preferred the foam grips.

DT Article
ID THYSANOPTERA
AB The relationship between budburst phenology and damage by the pear thrips (Taeniothrips inconsequens (UzeI) (Thysanoptera: Thripidae)) to sugar maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) foliage was investigated in two studies. In the first study, seedlings in cages were exposed to adult thrips at different stages of budburst. Compared with uninfested control seedlings, introduction of five adult thrips per bud reduced total leaf area and average leaf size, and caused chlorosis, tattering, and cupping of leaves. Leaf area reduction and damage symptoms were greater for seedlings exposed to thrips when leaf margins were first visible at the tip of the bud compared with earlier and later stages of budburst. In the second study, budburst date and number of thrips oviposition sites on leaves (an index of thrips activity) were measured in a common-garden test of maple saplings from open-pollinated families. Thrips activity was greater on early-breaking than late-breaking buds. Date of opening for these early-breaking buds coincided closely with peak capture of flying thrips. Both budburst date and number of oviposition sites on leaves differed among families. Sugar maple genotypes with late budburst escaped heavy thrips damage. The results indicate that timing of vegetative budburst in sugar maple can influence the degree of thrips damage.

AB The relation between environmental factors and leaf morphology of Zostera marina L. have long been unclear, primarily because the species is intrinsically variable. The common-garden method was used to determine the genetic, environmental, and interaction components of leaf size variation. Zostera marina consists of several ecotypes with a wide range of phenotypic plasticity. Variation in the morphology of Z. marina was of three types:  genetic, accounting for 14% across the localities studied; environmental (phenotypic plasticity along temporal and spatial gradients), accounting for 32%; and interaction between genotype and environmental, accounting for 35%. Five ecotypes were described for the North American Pacific coast:  Z. marina L. var. izembekensis Backman, Z. marina L. var. typica Setchell, Z. marina L. var. phillipsii Backman, Z. marina L. var. latifolia Morong, Z. marina L. var. atam Backman. Temporal variation was due to seasonal phenotypic changes in ecotypes. Zostera marina var. izembekensis showed little seasonal morphological changes; Z. marina var. typica demonstrated minor increase in leaf size in spring and summer. Zostera marina var. phillipsii and Z. marina var. latifolia behaved similarly in that leaf size of both increased markedly in spring through early summer. Zostera marina var. phillipsii is adapted to Hood Canal and Puget Sound while Z. marina var. latifolia occupies the outer coast. Zostera marina var. atam exhibits sexual reproduction exclusively and is specifically adapted to the Gulf of California.

AB To investigate the microgeographic spatial structure of genetic variation for quantitative traits in a natural population of Impatiens capensis, we performed a common-garden greenhouse experiment.  Seedlings were collected at 10-m intervals from a 40 x 40-m permanent grid in a natural population and grown to maturity in a greenhouse.  From these parents, 3 self-fertilized seed families per grid point were then grown in a randomized design in the greenhouse and scored for a variety of morphological and life-history traits.  Virtually all of the traits displayed significant variation among families, and many were significantly heterogeneous among grid points, indicating microgeographic genetic differentiation on a fine spatial scale.  Overall morphological divergence, measured as Mahalanobis distances between grid points, increased with geographical distance.  In general, spatial autocorrelation coefficients of grid point character means were positive at 11-20 m and negative beyond 40 m, although power for significance testing was low.  The first factor in a principal component analysis of grid point means was positively loaded on height-related traits and negatively loaded on total reproduction at 50 days, accounting for 31% of the variation.  This factor displayed significant positive spatial autocorrelation at 11-20 m and negative autocorrelation at > 40 m.  The remaining factors showed no detectable spatial structuring among grid points.  These differences in spatial pattern among characters suggest that forces other than drift may have influenced the genetic structure of the population.  There was no evidence for density-dependent selection; seedling density was not significantly correlated with the grid point mean of any trait.

AB Phenotypic and genotypic differentiation was investigated in a natural population of the annual weed Polygonum aviculare subsp. aequale experiencing heterogeneous trampling intensity.  Sixteen morphological and life history characters were studied.  Cultivation in untrampled conditions suggested that the differentiation observed in the field could be entirely accounted for by phenotypic plasticity.  A principal component analysis revealed that shoot length and all the variables describing metamer components were highly positively correlated with each other.  Moreover, they showed a similar plastic response, i.e. a marked decrease in relation to trampling intensity.  In contrast, biomass allocation to reproduction showed a positive response to trampling, while the total number of metamers and total weight showed no significant response to trampling.  It is suggested that the norms of reaction observed in the field are of adaptive value.

AB Three primary approaches have been used to study the genetics of migration:  the analyses of population differences, of single locus effects, and of polygenic influences.  Studies of populations reared under similar conditions in "common garden" experiments frequently reveal gene effects contributing to differences in migratory tendency.  Single locus effects are known, but are not common, a result to be expected given that migration is complex.  Quantitative genetic studies reveal that heritabilities for migration related traits are often high (approximately 0.5 or more) suggesting significant amounts of genetic variation on which natural selection can act.  Analyses of genetic correlations demonstrate that migratory behavior is part of a syndrome that includes aspects of both physiology and life history traits.  The latter are characteristically those which contribute to colonizing ability.  Migratory behavior thus does not evolve in isolation.  New migration patterns are still evolving, as would be predicted from observed environmental changes and the genetic variation present in migratory species.

AB Aboveground nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) requirement, retranslocation and use efficiency were determined for 28-year-old red oak (Quercus rubra L.), European larch (Larix decidua Miller), white pine (Pinus strobus L.), red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L) Karst.) plantations on a similar soil in southwestern Wisconsin.  Annual aboveground N and P requirements (kg/ha/yr) totaled 126 and 13 for red oak, 86 and 9 for European larch, 80 and 9 for white pine, 38 and 6 for red pine, and 81 and 13 for Norway spruce, respectively.  Nitrogen and P retranslocation from current foliage ranged from 81 and 72%, respectively, for European larch, whereas red pine retranslocated the smallest amount of N (13%) and Norway spruce retranslocated the smallest amount of P (18%).  In three evergreen species, uptake accounted for 72 to 74% of annual N requirement whereas for two deciduous species retranslocation accounted for 76 to 77% of the annual N requirement.  Nitrogen and P use (ANPP/uptake) was more efficient in deciduous species than evergreen species.  The results from this common garden experiment demonstrate that differences in N and P cycling among species may result from intrinsic characteristics (e.g. leaf longevity) rather than environmental conditions.

AB Morphological, physiological, and growth characteristics of western poison oak (Toxicodendron diversilobum (T. & G.)) Greene in a Californian site suggest that the shrub vs vine growth forms are determined by an environmental factor (the presence or absence of physical support), and not by ecotype. In a common garden, clones of shrubs and vines differed as a function of support in 11 variables (stem length, stem taper, internode length, mean and median vessel diameter, vessel lumen area/stem area, Huber value, specific hydraulic conductivity, and three indices of leaf vs stem elongation) but differed as a function of plant origin (shrub or vine) in only one variable (vessel density). In the field, supported (viney) and unsupported (shrubby) parts of the same plants differed significantly for seven variables: stem taper, stem modulus of elasticity in bending, Huber value, specific hydraulic conductivity, vessel lumen area/stem area, and mean and median vessel diameters; differences by plant origin could not be tested. Although much of the variation was due to plasticity, common garden experiments showed that source plants also differed from one another in many of the measured characteristics. Individuals of T. diversilobum will function ecologically as vines if grown with support but as shrubs in the absence of support.

AB Ruppia maritima L. from the west coast of Florida and North Carolina was grown from seeds under common garden conditions and showed the same pattern in growth and photosynthetic rates when exposed to different temperatures (14, 22, 30-degrees-C) or photoperiods (6, 12, 18 h L) but showed different responses to the salinities tested (10, 20, 30 parts per thousand). Photosynthetic responses were significantly higher for the northern population due to significantly elevated levels of Chl a in the North Carolina population. It is proposed that ecotypic differentiation with relation to levels of Chl a and photosynthetic responses to salinity have occurred between two R. maritima populations. This differentiation may be due to the different salinity regimes from which the seeds were collected. In contrast, no differentiation with relation to temperature or photoperiod is evident, perhaps reflecting the similar conditions for these two parameters during the growing season of R. maritima in these two habitats.

AB Replicated clones from ten populations of Spartina anglica C.E. Hubbard were grown in a common garden experiment to determine whether the phenotypic variation previously observed in natural habitats was due to inherent differences between clones.  For a range of morphological characters, mean differences between populations, and clonal repeatability, were very low.  Different morphological forms were, however, evident from differences in character correlations.  Thus, morphological variation appears to be dominated by phenotypic plasticity with a limited amount of possibly genetic differences distinguishing different morphological forms.  No differences in the relative variability of morphological characters were recorded between populations sampled from successionally adjacent salt-marsh zones, although the oldest population, from Poole Harbour, contained significantly less morphological variation than other populations.  The pattern of (a) flowering during the first year of the experiment, (b) clone survival, and (c) clonal growth, showed that the vigour of clones sampled from four successionally mature populations was significantly less than that of the other populations.  It is suggested that these consistent differences between populations are due to an age-related decline in vigour of clonal material and, thus, due to somatic variation rather than to genetic differences between populations.  The ecological implications of this interpretation are discussed in relation to the origin of S. anglica and the successional development and 'die-back' of natural populations.

AB This study investigated the effect of mechanical support on water transport properties and wood anatomy of stems of western poison oak, Toxicodendron diversilobum (T. & G.) Greene.  This plant grows as a vine when support is present but as a shrub when support is absent.  I compared vines and shrubs growing naturally in the field and those produced from cuttings of 11 source plants in a common garden.  Huber value (xylem transverse area/distal leaf area) was lower but specific conductivity (water volume.time-1.xylem transverse area-1.pressure gradient-1) was higher in supported than unsupported plants both in the field and the common garden.  The opposing effects of Huber value and specific conductivity resulted in the same values of leaf-specific conductivity (LSC, water volume.time-1.distal leaf area-1.pressure gradient-1) for supported and unsupported shoots at a given site.  Therefore, for the same rates of evapotranspiration, supported and unsupported shoots will have the same pressure gradients in their stems.  Vessel lumen composed a higher proportion of stem cross-section in supported than unsupported plants (due to slightly wider vessels and not to greater vessel density).  These results suggest that the narrow stems of supported plants are compensated hydraulically by the production of wider vessels:  at a given site, poison oak plants co-ordinate their leaf and xylem development such that their stems achieve the same overall conductive efficiencies (LSCs), regardless of support conditions.

AB In a common garden experiment, three morphological characters, corolla lobe length, corolla lobe width, and degree of leaf dissection, reliably distinguished the three varieties of Phacelia dubia as well as the closely related P. maculata.  The taxonomic merit of P. dubia var. interior was confirmed by this analysis, but prior reports that this taxon is dwarfed in habit were not verified.  Significant intravarietal variation among populations occurred in P. dubia var. georgiana and P. maculata, two taxa endemic to granite outcrops in the southeastern United States.  The occurrence of P. dubia in South Carolina was documented, but the varietal identity of these populations remains unclear; these plants probably represent an incipient variety.

AB Seed was collected along latitudinal transects from 575 loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and 650 sweetgum trees (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) distributed throughout Mississippi and adjacent parts of neighboring states. Progenies were compared on the basis of various morphological and phenological traits both in the nursery and after 10 years in plantings in the southern, central, and northern parts of the study area. Patterns of variation are presented graphically on a series of maps.
   Variation in both species has apparently evolved in response to the selection forces exerted by latitude-related (climatic) variables. Both species, however, show longitude-related variation in several traits which can be explained by assuming that both species were isolated into eastern and western populations during the Pleistocene.

AB Recreation ecology deals with the impact of outdoor recreation on natural or semi-natural environments.  The main activity considered in this review is walking (or trampling) but the effects of camping, horse riding, off-road vehicles, trail bikes and boating have all been studied 1-4.  The different levels of enquiry reviewed here, from overall community changes to plant (or in one case coral) morphology and plant anatomy, have gone hand in hand with management recommendations based on fundamental work.  The newer approaches include genetic analysis, a new structure for impact theory and more accurate predictive techniques for management.

ID RANUNCULUS-REPENS; PLANT DEMOGRAPHY; POPULATIONS
AB (1) Colonization and differentiation were studied in four populations (inland meadow, salt-marsh, polder and sand-dune) of the widespread grass Agrostis stolonifera.  A common-garden experiment showed that the overall population variability could be divided, through the use of principal component analysis, into three groups of characteristics: a group determined by the number and of size of stolons, a group determined by reproductive characteristics and a group determined by the yield of above-ground vegetative biomass.
   (2) A relationship was found between plant architecture and habitat: a few, long and thick stolons in the productive meadow site:  numerous, short and thin stolons in the salt-marsh site; a few, long and thin stolons in the bare and nutrient-poor sund-dune site; and the joint occurrence of all three biotypes in the polder site.
   (3) Significant differences in means between colonizing and non-colonizing populations were found for the number of inflorescences and reproductive biomass.
   (4) Within-population variation differed significantly between populations.  The meadow population was least variable, probably caused by the almost complete absence of sexuality in this population.
   (5) Stolon length, stolon diameter and leaf width were the characteristics with the lowest coefficients of variation within each population, suggesting the importance of these characteristics in population maintenance.
   (6) Differences in clonal structure, as detected by isozyme analysis, were most pronounced between the meadow population on the one hand (a few large clones) and the salt-marsh, polder and sand-dune populations on the other (higher density of small clones).

AB Comparison of cultured sporophytes and gametophytes in common-garden experiments confirmed the existence of ecotypic differences in light-related traits among populations of Laminaria saccharina (L.) Lamour.  Cultured sporophytes from the turbid habitat in Long Island Sound, New York, USA, grew faster under both limiting and saturating daily irradiances than sporophytes from shallow and deep habitats along the Atlantic coast of Maine.  Rapid growth of turbid plants was attributable to several factors, including high photosynthetic capacity and efficiency [due to differences in photosynthetic unit (PSU) number and size], low respiration rates, and high surface area:weight ratios.  In contrast to sporophytes, microscopic gametophytes from the three kelp populations grew at similar rates under limiting and saturating daily irradiances.  Biomass-specific photosynthesis vs irradiance (PI) parameters were similar for gametophytes from the shallow, deep, and turbid sites, despite population differences in chlorophyll-specific PI parameters and PSU characteristics.  However, turbid gametophytes produced microscopic sporophytes more rapidly than gametophytes from the shallow and deep sites, apparently due to a lower blue-light requirement for gametogenesis.  Ecotypic differences in sporophytes and gametogenesis.  Ecotypic differences in sporophytes and gametophytes of L. saccharina from shallow, deep, and turbid habitats can be understood as phase-specific adaptations.

AB Genotypes of white clover were collected from a range of hill country habitats defined by aspect, slope, fertiliser input, management, and stock class, and grown as spaced plants in a uniform environment.  Few morphological differences were found among genotypes that could be related to habitat of origin.  However, genotypes from rotationally grazed cattle pastures were taller than those from rotationally grazed sheep patures.  Effects of fertiliser input level on plant height and on leaf/flower height ratio, and effect of slope on leaf and flower heights and growth, were inconsistent.  Hill country genotypes had characters intermediate between 'Grasslands Tahora' and 'Grasslands Huia'.  Genotypes with (a) high and low proportions of nodes branching, (b) long and short internodes, and (c) large and small leaf sizes were selected and crossed in isolation.  Comparison of progeny with parents showed that differences in nodal branching frequency and internode length observed in the field were environmentally induced, whereas leaf size differences had a large genetic component.
